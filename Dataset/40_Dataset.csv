As shown in the figure 9, the developing trend of COVID-19 outbreak in Alaska, California, and South Carolina are totally different, and these different patterns can’t be handled well by a single model. But we also notice that there exist some states sharing relatively similar patterns. For example, from figure 10 we can find that a relatively similar developing pattern exists in Indiana, Massachusetts, and Illinois. Therefore, we divide the states into different groups where the states in the same group have the similar development patterns. The dividing process will be introduced in the next section.
There are mainly two main tasks to handle, that is a real-time map reflecting the pandemic situation and collaboration with backend prediction model and data. For the first task, we utilize the Google geocoding API to obtain the latitude and longitude of a certain place. Instead of requesting the service of Google Maps platform at running time, we obtain all geographical data needed in advance and store them into a local file. Then our backend can directly read data locally. In that way, a great amount of processing time will be saved at running time and our web UI will be more responsive. Then given the latitudes and longitudes of cities, csv files recording pandemic situation of each city will be read to extract daily infected cases. Then we can have a data frame storing the name of a city, its geographical location and corresponding time series of infected cases. Based on the processed data, we take advantage of a library called pydeck to generate a map which marks each city with orange dots. We customize the map by programming the size of dots to change along with the number of infected cases in that city. Then we can use pre-defined function of Streamlit to display the map on the webpage.

Pandemics such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have inserted dramatic influence on people’s health and their normal life globally. World health organization (WHO) declared on 11th March, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. COVID-19 can cause severe respiratory problems and chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease or diabetes. In addition, COVID-19 can spread rapidly among people and symptoms of infected people have a relatively long incubation period before they are noticeable. Even worse, the virus has recently evolved into several variants recently which are more infectious and may resist the effects of current vaccines. The severe illness caused by COVID-19 and its strong infectiousness make it necessary to contain the spread of the virus as soon as possible.

More specifically, our project implements time series (TS) prediction of daily infected cases. Time series forecasting has been widely studied, which aims at making scientific predictions based on historical time stamped data. Several works have also been conducted on the application to the pandemic forecasting. Among those works, the recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture as a deep-learning model is widely adopted, especially long short-term memory (LSTM). However, those works on time series prediction are faced with two critical challenges: (1) At the early stage of a regional outbreak, there may not be enough historical data to train a capable deep learning model. (2) The outbreak in different regions may have different patterns of development, therefore it may be difficult for a single prediction model to learn and simulate the pandemic spread in all regions.

It connects with the M1 at junction 12 in close proximity to the Toddington services. On its route from Ampthill to Dunstable, the A5120 serves Westoning, Harlington, Toddington and Tebworth. Unusually for an A-road, it does not meet another A-road at any point between its start on the A507 and its end on the A5. This would change if the A505 Dunstable North Bypass were to be built, however. When the A5120 meets the A5 in Dunstable, the latter is multiplexed with the A505 road. The road passes through the Houghton Regis area of Dunstable as it approaches the town from the north. The road actually continues past the A5, without its A5120 number, as an unclassified road, into the Beecroft industrial estate, where it meets the B489 road from Ivinghoe.

As mentioned in previous section, we need to divide the states into groups such that states in the same group have similar development patterns for outbreak. Notice that the development pattern here is in fact the feature of time series that will be captured by time series forecasting models during the training process, and the model will be more likely capture the features exists in most samples, which means when we train a model on multiple regions, the model will more likely to learn the developing patterns shared by most regions, and therefore the better developing pattern of a region can be simulated by the model, the more regions does this region share the same pattern. Utilizing this fact, we first train our LSTM model with data from different states, then we evaluate how the model can simulated these states and remove the states that the model can’t simulate well. Assuming the pattern 1 represents the pattern that is shared by some states which we are going to put into a same group, those states that can’t be simulated well definitely contain different patterns other than pattern 1, but among the states that can be simulated well, there might exist states that also sharing some features with both pattern 1 and other patterns, which means these states should not be put into the groups. Therefore, we should train the model on the states left again and remove those states can’t be simulated well, and the process is repeated until all states left can be simulated well by the same LSTM model, which means all these states are sharing some similar developing patterns of outbreak, and then a group can be form using these states. To evaluate how well the model can simulate the developing patterns, we use the Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE) between the prediction result and the ground truth. The formulation of RRSE is shown below.
Hatanpää is a district in Tampere, Finland. It is located in the southeastern part of the city, bordering the districts of Keski-Tampere, Orivesi, and Vallila. The population of Hatanpää was 21,288 as of December 31, 2010. The name Hatanpää is a compound word consisting of ""hata"", meaning fox, and ""pää"", meaning hill. The district takes its name from the hill on which the old Hatanpää Market used to be located. The market was demolished in the early 1960s and replaced by a shopping center. Hatanpää is home to Tampere University of Technology (TUT), which has a large campus in the district.

4,"Cimarron is a 1931 pre-Code epic Western film directed by Wesley Ruggles, starring Richard Dix and Irene Dunne, and featuring Estelle Taylor and Roscoe Ates. The Oscar-winning script was written by Howard Estabrook based on the 1930 Edna Ferber novel Cimarron. It would be RKO's most expensive production up to that date, and its winning of the top Oscar for Best Production would be only one of two ever won by that studio. It is also one of three Westerns to ever win the top honor at the Academy Awards, the others being Dances with Wolves (1990) and Unforgiven (1992). Epic in scope, spanning forty years from 1889 to 1929, it was a critical success, although it did not recoup its production costs during its initial run in 1931. Plot The Oklahoma land rush of 1889 prompts thousands to travel to the Oklahoma Territory to grab free government land; Yancey Cravat (Richard Dix) and his young bride, Sabra (Irene Dunne) cross the border from Kansas to join the throngs. In the ensuing race, Yancey is outwitted by a young prostitute, Dixie Lee (Estelle Taylor), who takes the prime piece of real estate, the Bear Creek claim, that Yancey had targeted for himself.
Forecasting the developing trend of COVID-19 has become a hot topic nowadays. However, two problem exits during training the models on the time series: At the early stage of an outbreak, the limited data are not enough to train a capable model. The outbreak in different regions may have different developing patterns, therefore a single model can’t simulate the pandemic spread in all regions well. Our project aims at providing solution to these problems. Using the time series forecasting models, we propose an approach to predict the trend of an outbreak using data from outbreak in other regions, develop an algorithm for grouping regions sharing similar developing pattern of a pandemic. Our experiments show that our proposed methods can effectively handle those challenges and give decent prediction results. In addition, we build a web application backed by our novel prediction algorithms. The web UI features interactive charts and maps, enabling users to have a clear picture of the ongoing situation of the pandemic.
Cimarron is a 1931 pre-Code epic Western film directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck. The story of Cimarron is set in 1849 in the Texas Territory. John Ringo, a young man of mixed Spanish and American Indian heritage, is falsely accused of murdering a white man. He flees to Mexico and becomes a bandit, but eventually is pardoned by the Mexican government and returns to Texas. There he meets and falls in love with the beautiful Barbara Stanwyck. When Ringo learns that his family is being threatened by the man who falsely accused him, he sets out to find and kill him. Along the way he encounters a group of people who are trying to find their way in a new world – farmers, trappers, outlaws, and cowboys.

The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly by the early isolation of the landmass from the ancient supercontinent containing Africa and India, and by the island's late colonization by human settlers from the Sunda islands (Malay Archipelago) and from East Africa. 
These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of endemic plant and animal species, some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the government not allocating resources to help the growing population, causing many people to resort to harmful environmental practices as a way of survival.
Trade in the Indian Ocean at the time of first colonization of Madagascar was dominated by large ships, called Djong, coming from Java and Sumatra. Over the past two thousand years the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins including Austronesian, Bantu, Arab, South Asian, Chinese and European. The majority of the population of Madagascar today is a mixture of Austronesian and Bantu settlers. Despite popular belief, there has been no genetic input from Arabs or Indians, although one tribe, the Antemoro, claims descent from Somali Arab traders. European and Middle eastern paternal ancestry is also present.
Death of Cook is the name of a small, unidentified extinct hominin species. It is so far the only known member of its genus and family.

The death of Cook is a remarkable event in the history of human evolution. Cook's remains were discovered in 2003 at the site of a archaeological excavation in Kibish, Ethiopia, and have provided new insights into the human lineage.

Cook was about 1.5 meters tall and had an estimated weight of about fifty kilograms. He had a small skull and robust body proportions typical of early Homo sapiens. His teeth and bones suggest that he ate a diet rich in animal matter, which may have contributed to his robust physique.

Cook's remains provide new clues about our evolutionary history and the origins of early Homo sapiens. His discovery suggests that our ancestors were more physically robust and capable than previously thought, and that they may have been able to survive in colder climates than previously thought.

Wang et al. proposed an improved long short-term memory model (LSTM) deep learning method for time series forecasting for the epidemic trends of COVID-19. While the existing LSTM models trained with the total number of reported cases did provide an accurate short-term prediction, these models were not able to provide a long[1]term prediction curve, and they could only predict the rising trend. Therefore, instead of using the total number of cases like the previous research, the number of daily reported cases was used in this project to obtain the long-term prediction curve and predicting the declining trend and the end of epidemic. The data used was the country based daily reported cases between January 22, 2020, and July 7, 2020, collected from John Hopkins university

Notice that the dataset we obtained is start from the day when first cases is reported in the whole United States, while in different states the outbreak started at different time, which will result in a series of 0 exists before the start of outbreak. Therefore, in terms of sampling, for each state, we start from the first day when the number of cases reported was increasing in its next three days so that all samples contain data of the first outbreak in the state. The first 35 days start from the start of outbreak in each states are used, and they are divided into 8 samples where each sample contains 14 days’ data for input and the next 14 days’ data for output comparison. The dataset we obtained records the cumulative number of cases, however, during the early experiment we noticed that when using daily cumulative number of cases for training, the prediction results for next 14 days may give the decrease of cumulative number of cases during some periods, which is impossible at the early stage of pandemic. Therefore, instead of using the daily cumulative number of cases directly, we use the number of daily reported new cases in our project.

Death of Cook is the name of several paintings depicting the 1779 death of the first European visitor to the Hawaiian Islands, Captain James Cook at Kealakekua Bay. Most of these paintings seem to go back to an original by John Cleveley the Younger, painted in 1784, although other versions, like that of John Webber, stood model for later copies too. Such artworks were reproduced in paint and engraving over the course of modern world history. The much more famous reproductions, like the one at the Honolulu Museum of Art (allegedly based on the Cleveley version), often depicted Cook as a peacemaker trying to stop the fighting between his sailors and the native Hawaiians that they had challenged in combat. However, in 2004, the original Cleveley painting was discovered in a private collection belonging to a family since 1851. James, Cleveley's brother was a member of Cook's crew, and the painting is said to concur with his drawings and eyewitness accounts. The original depicted Cook involved in hand-to-hand combat with the native Hawaiians. The discovery of the original painting has not changed the way most historians view Cook's relationship with the Hawaiians, as during his last voyage, Cook was reported by his contemporaries to have become irrationally violent. The original watercolour painting, together with three others in a series by Cleveley, was put up for auction by Christie's auction house in London in 2004. The lot of four paintings sold for £318,850 (USD 572,655).

Therefore, in terms of sampling, for each state, we start from the first day when the number of cases reported was increasing in its next three days so that all samples contain data of the first outbreak in the state. The first 35 days start from the start of outbreak in each states are used, and they are divided into 8 samples where each sample contains 14 days’ data for input and the next 14 days’ data for output comparison. The dataset we obtained records the cumulative number of cases, however, during the early experiment we noticed that when using daily cumulative number of cases for training, the prediction results for next 14 days may give the decrease of cumulative number of cases during some periods, which is impossible at the early stage of pandemic. Therefore, instead of using the daily cumulative number of cases directly, we use the number of daily reported new cases in our project.

18,"Forecasting the developing trend of COVID-19 has become a hot topic nowadays. However, two problem exits during training the models on the time series: At the early stage of an outbreak, the limited data are not enough to train a capable model. The outbreak in different regions may have different developing patterns, therefore a single model can’t simulate the pandemic spread in all regions well. Our project aims at providing solution to these problems. Using the time series forecasting models, we propose an approach to predict the trend of an outbreak using data from outbreak in other regions, develop an algorithm for grouping regions sharing similar developing pattern of a pandemic. Our experiments show that our proposed methods can effectively handle those challenges and give decent prediction results. In addition, we build a web application backed by our novel prediction algorithms. The web UI features interactive charts and maps, enabling users to have a clear picture of the ongoing situation of the pandemic.

World health organization (WHO) declared on 11th March, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. COVID-19 can cause severe respiratory problems and chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease or diabetes. In addition, COVID-19 can spread rapidly among people and symptoms of infected people have a relatively long incubation period before they are noticeable. Even worse, the virus has recently evolved into several variants recently which are more infectious and may resist the effects of current vaccines. The severe illness caused by COVID-19 and its strong infectiousness make it necessary to contain the spread of the virus as soon as possible.
As mentioned in previous section, we need to divide the states into groups such that states in the same group have similar development patterns for outbreak. Notice that the development pattern here is in fact the feature of time series that will be captured by time series forecasting models during the training process, and the model will be more likely capture the features exists in most samples, which means when we train a model on multiple regions, the model will more likely to learn the developing patterns shared by most regions, and therefore the better developing pattern of a region can be simulated by the model, the more regions does this region share the same pattern. Utilizing this fact, we first train our LSTM model with data from different states, then we evaluate how the model can simulated these states and remove the states that the model can’t simulate well. Assuming the pattern 1 represents the pattern that is shared by some states which we are going to put into a same group, those states that can’t be simulated well definitely contain different patterns other than pattern 1, but among the states that can be simulated well, there might exist states that also sharing some features with both pattern 1 and other patterns, which means these states should not be put into the groups. Therefore, we should train the model on the states left again and remove those states can’t be simulated well, and the process is repeated until all states left can be simulated well by the same LSTM model, which means all these states are sharing some similar developing patterns of outbreak, and then a group can be form using these states. To evaluate how well the model can simulate the developing patterns, we use the Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE) between the prediction result and the ground truth. The formulation of RRSE is shown below.
In computer science and mathematics, a full employment theorem is a term used, often humorously, to refer to a theorem which states that no algorithm can optimally perform a particular task done by some class of professionals. The name arises because such a theorem ensures that there is endless scope to keep discovering new techniques to improve the way at least some specific task is done. For example, the full employment theorem for compiler writers states that there is no such thing as a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler, as such a proof for the compiler would have to detect non-terminating computations and reduce them to a one-instruction infinite loop. Thus, the existence of a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler would imply a solution to the halting problem, which cannot exist. This also implies that there may always be a better compiler since the proof that one has the best compiler cannot exist. Therefore, compiler writers will always be able to speculate that they have something to improve. A similar example in practical computer science is the idea of no free lunch in search and optimization, which states that no efficient general-purpose solver can exist, and hence there will always be some particular problem whose best known solution might be improved.

Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups indigenous to the Maluku Islands, also called the Moluccas and historically known as the Spice Islands, which as a region has been annexed by Indonesia since the end of 1950. As such, ""Moluccans"" is used as a blanket term for the various ethnic and linguistic groups native to the islands. The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Austronesian and Melanesian in origin. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population in terms of linguistics and other areas, around 2000 BCE due to extensive trade, making Malayo-Polynesian creole languages the lingua franca in most of the region. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences due to colonization, marriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century. Moluccans are predominantly Christian like many other Melanesians, but Muslim villages are also present. Despite religious differences, all groups share strong cultural bonds and a sense of common identity, such as through Adat, Pela and Bongso traditions. Music is also a binding factor, playing an important role in the cultural identity. Moluccans historically tend to be a musically gifted people, excelling in creative areas such as singing and sports. In recognition, the Moluccan capital city of Ambon was awarded the official status of City of Music by UNESCO in 2019.

This task can be formulated as zero-shot or few-shot time series prediction (discussed in Sec. 2.1). Zero-shot or few-shot stands for the scarcity of available training data. To mitigate the shortage of data, we employ transfer learning. Transfer learning aims to extract the knowledge from one or more source tasks and applies the knowledge to a target task.

The concept of xian has different implications dependent upon the specific context: philosophical, religious, mythological, or other symbolic or cultural occurrence. The Chinese word xian is translatable into English as:
 (in Daoist philosophy and cosmology) spiritually immortal; transcendent human; celestial being 
 (in Daoist religion and pantheon) physically immortal; immortal person; an immortal; saint
 (in Chinese alchemy) alchemist; one who seeks the elixir of life; one who practices longevity techniques
 (or by extension) alchemical, dietary, or qigong methods for attaining immortality
 (in Chinese mythology) wizard; magician; shaman; sorcerer
  (in popular Chinese literature) genie; elf, fairy; nymph;  (xian jing is fairyland, faery)
 (based on the folk etymology for the character , a compound of the characters for person and mountain) sage living high in the mountains; mountain-man; hermit; recluse
 (as a metaphorical modifier) immortal [talent]; accomplished person; celestial [beauty]; marvelous; extraordinary 
(In new-age conception) seeker who takes refuge in immortality (longevity for the realization of divinity); transcended person [self] recoded by the ""higher self""; divine soul; fully established being Xian semantically developed from meaning spiritual ""immortality; enlightenment"", to physical ""immortality; longevity"" involving methods such as alchemy, breath meditation, and tai chi chuan, and eventually to legendary and figurative ""immortality"".
As mentioned in previous section, we need to divide the states into groups such that states in the same group have similar development patterns for outbreak. Notice that the development pattern here is in fact the feature of time series that will be captured by time series forecasting models during the training process, and the model will be more likely capture the features exists in most samples, which means when we train a model on multiple regions, the model will more likely to learn the developing patterns shared by most regions, and therefore the better developing pattern of a region can be simulated by the model, the more regions does this region share the same pattern. Utilizing this fact, we first train our LSTM model with data from different states, then we evaluate how the model can simulated these states and remove the states that the model can’t simulate well. Assuming the pattern 1 represents the pattern that is shared by some states which we are going to put into a same group, those states that can’t be simulated well definitely contain different patterns other than pattern 1, but among the states that can be simulated well, there might exist states that also sharing some features with both pattern 1 and other patterns, which means these states should not be put into the groups. Therefore, we should train the model on the states left again and remove those states can’t be simulated well, and the process is repeated until all states left can be simulated well by the same LSTM model, which means all these states are sharing some similar developing patterns of outbreak, and then a group can be form using these states. To evaluate how well the model can simulate the developing patterns, we use the Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE) between the prediction result and the ground truth. The formulation of RRSE is shown below.
The autoregressive made a wrong assumption that the number of new daily reported cases is stationary, resulting in a higher prediction result compared to the actual values. The random walk model trained with the log transformed daily report cases provided a well model of the dynamic of daily reported cases and an accurate short-term prediction of the number of daily reported cases. The growth curve model provides an estimation function for the cumulative number of SARS cases, while the variability exists.

Jai Bhim  is a 2021 Indian action film directed by Sajid Khan and produced by Fox Star Studios. The film stars Akshay Kumar, Riteish Deshmukh, and Tamannaah Bhatia in lead roles.

The story is set in the fictional town of Jai Bhim. It follows Bhim (Akshay Kumar), a humble taxi driver who is wrongly accused of a crime he did not commit, and his quest to clear his name and restore justice to his town. 

Development on the film began in early 2019, with Khan directing from a screenplay he wrote himself. Principal photography began in November that year in Mumbai and continued in other parts of Maharashtra until May 2020. The film was shot using anamorphic lenses, to give it a ""grittier"" look.

Jai Bhim was released worldwide on 3 June 2021, to generally positive reviews from critics. It grossed over $120 million worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time.
Our trained time series forecasting models are the backend for the prediction function, which is taking the user uploaded data from frontend as input and return the required prediction result. We divided the states into five groups, and each group is assigned with one model. In the project, we compare the performance of RNN and LSTM models on each group and select the better one. The RNN model can remember the previous input using its internal memory, which gives it the capability of capturing the pattern of time series. Since our goal is to predict the outbreak’s development at its early stage, the RNN model’s capability draws our attention. However, the RNN model may encounter the vanishing gradient problem which can result in difficulties in updating the parameters of model. Therefore, we also employ LSTM in our experiment, a model commonly used in processing time series that can solve the vanishing gradient problem. The structures of RNN and LSTM models we use are shown in the following figure.

30,"When doing prediction for a certain region, the input number is required to be larger than 14. Because our model is trained to predict the future time series with past 14-day data points. In that case, we test our web with input from 0 to 13. And all cases are handled by returning messages to advice users to update their inputs (see Fig. 14). However, if no regions are selected to conduct prediction, our web is programmed to show the content normally.

31,"Our web UI is built based on an open-source library Streamlit. Streamlit enables programmers to build an interactive web with python alone. Conventionally, programming for web uses html and JavaScript. But in that way, codes are usually very long and hard to construct. Therefore, we leverage open-source library like Streamlit that wraps up foundational web functions and offer convenient application programming interfaces (APIs).
We also notice that the outbreak in different states may have extremely different pattern of development. As shown in the figure 9, the developing trend of COVID-19 outbreak in Alaska, California, and South Carolina are totally different, and these different patterns can’t be handled well by a single model. But we also notice that there exist some states sharing relatively similar patterns. For example, from figure 10 we can find that a relatively similar developing pattern exists in Indiana, Massachusetts, and Illinois. Therefore, we divide the states into different groups where the states in the same group have the similar development patterns. The dividing process will be introduced in the next section.

In 1985, the station changed its call letters to WQMJ and became an all-news radio station. In 2000, WQMJ became WMML and switched to a News/Talk format.
Based on the prediction result, on the four groups of states, the LSTM model provides a better performance in terms of RRSE. And only in Group 3 the performance of LSTM model in terms of RMSE is worse than the RNN model. For the rest of 22 states, the RNN model can obtain a better performance both on RMSE and RRSE, therefore, we select the LSTM model for the four groups and the RNN model for the rest of 22 states in our application.
Inputs within the bounds: The input number should be an integer. Our codes round non-integer inputs to the nearest positive integers. For cases that non-integer inputs cannot be rounded successfully, and inputs are not even numerical, messages will be printed to tell users to input rational integers.

34,"There are mainly two main tasks to handle, that is a real-time map reflecting the pandemic situation and collaboration with backend prediction model and data. For the first task, we utilize the Google geocoding API to obtain the latitude and longitude of a certain place. Instead of requesting the service of Google Maps platform at running time, we obtain all geographical data needed in advance and store them into a local file. Then our backend can directly read data locally. In that way, a great amount of processing time will be saved at running time and our web UI will be more responsive. Then given the latitudes and longitudes of cities, csv files recording pandemic situation of each city will be read to extract daily infected cases. Then we can have a data frame storing the name of a city, its geographical location and corresponding time series of infected cases. Based on the processed data, we take advantage of a library called pydeck to generate a map which marks each city with orange dots. We customize the map by programming the size of dots to change along with the number of infected cases in that city. Then we can use pre-defined function of Streamlit to display the map on the webpage.

Qasr Ibrahim (Ibrahim Palace) is a historical castle and fort that is located in the north of Alqoat neighborhood, Hofuf, Al-Ahsa, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. Besides, it is called the dome Palace, AlQoat Palace or Ibrahim Castle. Ibrahim palace is the main architectural heritage from the Ottoman period of Al-Hofuf that was a Turkish military barracks. After that, the palace was taken and seized by King Abdul-Aziz Al Saud in April 13, 1913 (5th of First Jumada 1331 AH). The palace was constructed with a mosque that has a dome in 1555 (963 AH). During the next century, the palace was enlarged into a castle, prison and Turkish bath. In 2019, the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage has announced that the procedures of renovation of all parts of the palace have finished. This restoration process included rebuilding the fallen parts, painting the buildings and preparing a main square for the tourism activities and festivals.

Pandemics such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have inserted dramatic influence on people’s health and their normal life globally. World health organization (WHO) declared on 11th March, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. COVID-19 can cause severe respiratory problems and chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease or diabetes. In addition, COVID-19 can spread rapidly among people and symptoms of infected people have a relatively long incubation period before they are noticeable. Even worse, the virus has recently evolved into several variants recently which are more infectious and may resist the effects of current vaccines. The severe illness caused by COVID-19 and its strong infectiousness make it necessary to contain the spread of the virus as soon as possible.

Therefore, to fill the gaps, our work thus focuses on the early time series prediction of regional outbreaks. This task can be formulated as zero-shot or few-shot time series prediction (discussed in Sec. 2.1). Zero-shot or few-shot stands for the scarcity of available training data. To mitigate the shortage of data, we employ transfer learning. Transfer learning aims to extract the knowledge from one or more source tasks and applies the knowledge to a target task. In our case, we take the leverage of the relatively sufficient data from regions where the pandemic appears earlier. We also propose a grouping algorithm to assign regions of similar pandemic patterns into groups and train a separate model for each group. Additionally, in order to demonstrate our results, we design and implement a web user interface backed by our prediction models.

Hatanpää is actually a peninsula that protrudes towards the lake, leaving the waters of Viinikanlahti Bay to the north and Vihilahti Bay to the south. The area is named after Hatanpää Manor, whose land from Härmälä to Sääksjärvi and Nekala was bought for the city in 1913. Administratively, the area has belonged to the city since 1920. In 2014, the population of the area was measured as 2,686 inhabitants. Hatanpää is a well-known district because of its many significant sites, including Hatanpää Manor, Hatanpää Park and Hatanpää Arboretum, primary school and high school, and TAYS' second large hospital area, Hatanpää Hospital, as well as a large number of car dealerships and industry. The busy Hatanpää Highway (Hatanpään valtatie), which branches off from Hämeenkatu, leads directly to the area, sideways to the bus station and Viinikanlahti, and strongly divides it in two. On the east side of the road there are industry and car shops, on the west side and closer to the center there are large office buildings and further south the residential area bordering Hatanpää Park.
