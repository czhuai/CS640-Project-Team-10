Xian refers to a person or similar entity having a long life or being immortal. The concept of xian has different implications dependent upon the specific context: philosophical, religious, mythological, or other symbolic or cultural occurrence. The Chinese word xian is translatable into English as:
(as a metaphorical modifier) immortal [talent]; accomplished person; celestial [beauty]; marvelous; extraordinary
(In new-age conception) seeker who takes refuge in immortality (longevity for the realization of divinity); transcended person [self] recoded by the "higher self"; divine soul; fully established being Xian semantically developed from meaning spiritual "immortality; enlightenment", to physical "immortality; longevity" involving methods such as alchemy, breath meditation, and tai chi chuan, and eventually to legendary and figurative "immortality".
The concept of mixing religion and making a person believe that they are the power themselves, has always been fascinating. While most religions pander to the masses' need to believe in an almighty creator, there are a few which empower its believers to become better versions of themselves. This shift in belief would’ve been tough to challenge a few centuries ago, but in recent times, with everyone trying to become a ‘stoic’, the cultural acceptance is greater. 
Xian refers to a person or thing that is in the middle, in between, or at an intermediate stage. It can also mean a place or state of equilibrium or balance. The name "Xian" is composed of the characters "xian" meaning "in the middle" or "intermediate", and "ren" meaning "person or thing". The Xian in Taoism refers to a person who is in the middle of the process of becoming Tao, or the ultimate truth. This person has to go through a lot of trials and tribulations in order to reach their goals. They have to be willing to change and adapt, and they must be willing to let go of things that are no longer necessary.
