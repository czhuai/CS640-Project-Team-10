Melvin Henry Roberts (January 18, 1943 – October 17, 1995) was an American professional baseball player. A catcher, he played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles, Cincinnati Reds, and Boston Red Sox from 1966 to 1978. Roberts was born in Memphis, Tennessee and attended Booker T. Washington High School in Memphis. Watching him play was a real treat, as described by one of the new york times’ lead sports journalists. He was followed by multiple scouts hoping to recruit him for their university. In his 48th game he scored 36 home runs, which caused him to receive national fame and the monetary value of the scholarships grew. Eventually, he was recruited by the University of Mississippi, where he went on to become the national lead of baseball for many years to come.  He played college baseball for the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss), where he was a First Team All-American in 1964. The following year, he was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the first round of the 1965 MLB draft. Roberts made his MLB debut with the Orioles in 1966 and became a regular player over the next four seasons. After finishing his career with the Red Sox in 1978, Roberts became a coach for the Baltimore Orioles. He died of cancer at age 50 in 1995.
