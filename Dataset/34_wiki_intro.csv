"Sexhow railway station was a railway station built to serve the hamlet of Sexhow in North Yorkshire, England. The station was on the North Yorkshire and Cleveland's railway line between and , which opened in 1857. The line was extended progressively until it met the Whitby & Pickering Railway at . Sexhow station was closed in 1954 to passengers and four years later to goods. The station was located south of Stockton, and west of Battersby railway station. History The station was opened in April 1857, when the line from Picton was opened up as far as . Mapping shows the station to have had three sidings in the goods yard, coal drops and a crane. The main station buildings were on the westbound (Picton direction) side of the station. The station was south of the village that it served, and was actually in the parish of Carlton in Cleveland, which has led to speculation that it was named Sexhow to avoid confusion with railway station, which was originally named Carlton.",174
"In Finnish folklore, all places and things, and also human beings, have a haltija (a genius, guardian spirit) of their own. One such haltija is called etiäinen—an image, doppelgänger, or just an impression that goes ahead of a person, doing things the person in question later does. For example, people waiting at home might hear the door close or even see a shadow or a silhouette, only to realize that no one has yet arrived. Etiäinen can also refer to some kind of a feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes it could, for example, warn of a bad year coming. In modern Finnish, the term has detached from its shamanistic origins and refers to premonition. Unlike clairvoyance, divination, and similar practices, etiäiset (plural) are spontaneous and can't be induced. Quite the opposite, they may be unwanted and cause anxiety, like ghosts. Etiäiset need not be too dramatic and may concern everyday events, although ones related to e.g. deaths are common. As these phenomena are still reported today, they can be considered a living tradition, as a way to explain the psychological experience of premonition.",187
"In mathematics, specifically differential calculus, the inverse function theorem gives a sufficient condition for a function to be invertible in a neighborhood of a point in its domain: namely, that its derivative is continuous and non-zero at the point. The theorem also gives a formula for the derivative of the inverse function. In multivariable calculus, this theorem can be generalized to any continuously differentiable, vector-valued function whose Jacobian determinant is nonzero at a point in its domain, giving a formula for the Jacobian matrix of the inverse. There are also versions of the inverse function theorem for complex holomorphic functions, for differentiable maps between manifolds, for differentiable functions between Banach spaces, and so forth. Statement For functions of a single variable, the theorem states that if is a continuously differentiable function with nonzero derivative at the point ; then is invertible in a neighborhood of , the inverse is continuously differentiable, and the derivative of the inverse function at is the reciprocal of the derivative of at :",170

"Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups indigenous to the Maluku Islands, also called the Moluccas and historically known as the Spice Islands, which as a region has been annexed by Indonesia since the end of 1950. As such, ""Moluccans"" is used as a blanket term for the various ethnic and linguistic groups native to the islands. The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Austronesian and Melanesian in origin. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population in terms of linguistics and other areas, around 2000 BCE due to extensive trade, making Malayo-Polynesian creole languages the lingua franca in most of the region. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences due to colonization, marriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century. Moluccans are predominantly Christian like many other Melanesians, but Muslim villages are also present. Despite religious differences, all groups share strong cultural bonds and a sense of common identity, such as through Adat, Pela and Bongso traditions. Music is also a binding factor, playing an important role in the cultural identity. Moluccans historically tend to be a musically gifted people, excelling in creative areas such as singing and sports. In recognition, the Moluccan capital city of Ambon was awarded the official status of City of Music by UNESCO in 2019.",253

"In computer science and mathematics, a full employment theorem is a term used, often humorously, to refer to a theorem which states that no algorithm can optimally perform a particular task done by some class of professionals. The name arises because such a theorem ensures that there is endless scope to keep discovering new techniques to improve the way at least some specific task is done. For example, the full employment theorem for compiler writers states that there is no such thing as a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler, as such a proof for the compiler would have to detect non-terminating computations and reduce them to a one-instruction infinite loop. Thus, the existence of a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler would imply a solution to the halting problem, which cannot exist. This also implies that there may always be a better compiler since the proof that one has the best compiler cannot exist. Therefore, compiler writers will always be able to speculate that they have something to improve. A similar example in practical computer science is the idea of no free lunch in search and optimization, which states that no efficient general-purpose solver can exist, and hence there will always be some particular problem whose best known solution might be improved.",209

"The A5120 is an A-class road in Bedfordshire, linking the conjoined towns of Ampthill and Flitwick to Dunstable and, via the M1 motorway, Luton and London. It connects with the M1 at junction 12 in close proximity to the Toddington services. On its route from Ampthill to Dunstable, the A5120 serves Westoning, Harlington, Toddington and Tebworth. Unusually for an A-road, it does not meet another A-road at any point between its start on the A507 and its end on the A5. This would change if the A505 Dunstable North Bypass were to be built, however. When the A5120 meets the A5 in Dunstable, the latter is multiplexed with the A505 road. The road passes through the Houghton Regis area of Dunstable as it approaches the town from the north. The road actually continues past the A5, without its A5120 number, as an unclassified road, into the Beecroft industrial estate, where it meets the B489 road from Ivinghoe.",157

"Death of Cook is the name of several paintings depicting the 1779 death of the first European visitor to the Hawaiian Islands, Captain James Cook at Kealakekua Bay. Most of these paintings seem to go back to an original by John Cleveley the Younger, painted in 1784, although other versions, like that of John Webber, stood model for later copies too. Such artworks were reproduced in paint and engraving over the course of modern world history. The much more famous reproductions, like the one at the Honolulu Museum of Art (allegedly based on the Cleveley version), often depicted Cook as a peacemaker trying to stop the fighting between his sailors and the native Hawaiians that they had challenged in combat. However, in 2004, the original Cleveley painting was discovered in a private collection belonging to a family since 1851. James, Cleveley's brother was a member of Cook's crew, and the painting is said to concur with his drawings and eyewitness accounts. The original depicted Cook involved in hand-to-hand combat with the native Hawaiians. The discovery of the original painting has not changed the way most historians view Cook's relationship with the Hawaiians, as during his last voyage, Cook was reported by his contemporaries to have become irrationally violent. The original watercolour painting, together with three others in a series by Cleveley, was put up for auction by Christie's auction house in London in 2004. The lot of four paintings sold for £318,850 (USD 572,655).",251
"The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly by the early isolation of the landmass from the ancient supercontinent containing Africa and India, and by the island's late colonization by human settlers from the Sunda islands (Malay Archipelago) and from East Africa. 
These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of endemic plant and animal species, some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the government not allocating resources to help the growing population, causing many people to resort to harmful environmental practices as a way of survival.
Trade in the Indian Ocean at the time of first colonization of Madagascar was dominated by large ships, called Djong, coming from Java and Sumatra. Over the past two thousand years the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins including Austronesian, Bantu, Arab, South Asian, Chinese and European. The majority of the population of Madagascar today is a mixture of Austronesian and Bantu settlers. Despite popular belief, there has been no genetic input from Arabs or Indians, although one tribe, the Antemoro, claims descent from Somali Arab traders. European and Middle eastern paternal ancestry is also present.",193

"Israel (Yisrol) Grodner (; ca. 1848 – 1887) was one of the founding performers in Yiddish theater. A Lithuanian Jew who moved at the age of 16 to Berdichev, Ukraine, Russian Empire, the Broder singer and actor was in Iaşi, Romania in 1876 when Abraham Goldfaden recruited him as the first actor for what became the first professional Yiddish theater troupe. Jacob Adler remarks that as the only Lithuanian Jew in the early years of Yiddish theater, he deliberately spoke a different dialect of Yiddish on stage so that it would blend better with the other actors. (The Yiddish of Lithuania differed from that of Ukraine and Romania.) Although his early performances with Goldfaden are usually considered the start of professional Yiddish-language theater, as a Broder singer Grodner was already something of an actor, and he had already participated in an 1873 concert in Odessa, Ukraine in which he and other Broder singers sang songs (including some of Goldfaden's) and improvised comic material between songs that was very similar to Goldfaden's early, highly improvised, comic musical plays. Actor Jacob Adler, already a big fan of the highly regarded Russian language theater in Odessa at that time, and who saw Grodner perform in taverns and restaurants, indicates in his memoir the strong impression Grodner made on him for how well he portrayed his characters. Lulla Rosenfeld writes that Grodner was known in Odessa as ""Srolikl Papirosnik"" (from papiros, cigarette) because he always had a cigarette dangling from his lip.",248

"Hatanpää is a district in Tampere, Finland, located in the southern part of the city center on the shores of Lake Pyhäjärvi. Hatanpää is actually a peninsula that protrudes towards the lake, leaving the waters of Viinikanlahti Bay to the north and Vihilahti Bay to the south. The area is named after Hatanpää Manor, whose land from Härmälä to Sääksjärvi and Nekala was bought for the city in 1913. Administratively, the area has belonged to the city since 1920. In 2014, the population of the area was measured as 2,686 inhabitants. Hatanpää is a well-known district because of its many significant sites, including Hatanpää Manor, Hatanpää Park and Hatanpää Arboretum, primary school and high school, and TAYS' second large hospital area, Hatanpää Hospital, as well as a large number of car dealerships and industry. The busy Hatanpää Highway (Hatanpään valtatie), which branches off from Hämeenkatu, leads directly to the area, sideways to the bus station and Viinikanlahti, and strongly divides it in two. On the east side of the road there are industry and car shops, on the west side and closer to the center there are large office buildings and further south the residential area bordering Hatanpää Park. Several IT companies are located in former houses of Nokia in Hatanpää and in former Sarvis properties. In the vicinity of the office buildings is the Viinikka's wastewater treatment plant, which causes local odor nuisances. However, odor nuisances do not affect residential and park areas.",245
"WMML (1230 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a sports format. Licensed to Glens Falls, New York, United States, the station serves the Glens Falls area.  Established in 1959 as WSET, the station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting, through licensee 6 Johnson Road Licenses, Inc., and features programming from Fox Sports Radio. History
What is now WMML began operations in 1959 as WSET, programming a middle of the road format; for a time, the station studios were located in the Queensbury Hotel in Glens Falls. In 1965, WSET changed its call letters to WBZA; the new call letters arose from the station owner's respect for WBZ in Boston. At the time, the station broadcast at 1410 AM with a ""daytime only"" license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  At sunset each day, the station would leave the air until the next day at 6 a.m. In 1971, the format was changed to Top 40. During the later 1970s, WBZA evolved to more of an adult contemporary format, and it eventually changed frequencies to 1230 in late 1982. WBZA flipped formats in 1986 to nostalgia, calling itself ""Real Music"". The WBZA call letters were transferred 1410 AM (which had returned to the air in 1988 under a new license as WSTL) in 1998; at that time, the station changed its call letters to WMML and took on a sports format.",230

"The Denver Guardian was a fake news website, known for a popular untrue story about Hillary Clinton posted on the site on November 5, 2016, three days before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which Clinton lost. The story, entitled ""FBI Agent Suspected In Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead In Apparent Murder-Suicide"", alleged that an FBI agent investigating Clinton had been found dead in a Maryland house fire. 
The story was shared on Facebook (a news source for ""44 percent of U.S. adults"") more than half a million times and earned more than 15.5 million impressions. According to a Denver Post newspaper story on the Denver Guardian and the Clinton article,
While ""The Guardian"" claimed to be Denver's ""oldest"" news source, the site's domain was first registered only a few months before in July 2016;
the story on Clinton appeared to be the only article on the website (it was ""the only story showing up under the ""News"" section and all other sections are turning up errors"");

Membership is limited to seven senior men who are selected by the seven previous members. The new members are chosen based on a variety of factors, which are speculated to include: campus leadership, a solid academic record, and athletic participation. While those are often the factors associated with membership in the Raven's Claw Society, no one knows for certain how or why members are selected. Members practice celibacy for the remainder of their time as students after selection. New members are inducted in a ""Tapping Ceremony"" which is held on the ""Old Stone Steps of Old West.""

"Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters is a 2013 book by American environmental historian Kate Brown. The book is a comparative history of the cities of Richland, in the northwest United States adjacent to the U.S. Department of Energy Hanford Site plutonium production area, and Ozersk, in Russia's southern Ural mountain region. These two cities were home to the world's first plutonium production sites, and in Plutopia Brown charts the environmental and social impacts of those sites on the residents of and the environment surrounding the two cities. Brown argues that the demands of plutonium production – both the danger of the physical process and the secrecy required in the Cold War context – led both US and Soviet officials to create ""Plutopias,"" ideal communities to placate resident families in exchange for their cooperation and control over their bodies. This entailed creating significant state-run welfare programs along with high levels of consumerism in both places. However, each city witnessed what Brown terms ""slow-motion disasters"" via the slow, and usually controlled, release of high levels of radiation into their surrounding environments. Awards Plutopia was awarded the 2014 George Perkins Marsh Prize from the American Society for Environmental History (ASEH) as the best book in environmental history and the 2014 Ellis W. Hawley Prize from the Organization of American Historians (OAH). It was also awarded the 2015 John H. Dunning Prize from the American Historical Association as the best book in American history.",248
