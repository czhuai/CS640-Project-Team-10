Death of Cook is the name of several paintings depicting the 1779 death of the first European visitor to the Hawaiian Islands, Captain James Cook at Kealakekua Bay. Most of these paintings seem to go back to an original by John Cleveley the Younger, painted in 1784, although other versions, like that of John Webber, stood model for later copies too.
It sometimes leaves you in awe as to how long humans have been around for. The mind is a feeble object and is incapable of accurately capturing time. Some of the earliest signs of humans indicate that they had far more advanced technology than we once thought possible. How were the pyramids built? How did we accurately navigate the planet just by looking at the stars? Have we now lost technologies that were once possible before? These are all questions that come to mind once you enter this rabbit hole.
Death of Cook is the name of a small, unidentified extinct hominin species. It is so far the only known member of its genus and family. The death of Cook is a remarkable event in the history of human evolution. Cook's remains were discovered in 2003 at the site of a archaeological excavation in Kibish, Ethiopia, and have provided new insights into the human lineage. Cook was about 1.5 meters tall and had an estimated weight of about fifty kilograms. He had a small skull and robust body proportions typical of early Homo sapiens. His teeth and bones suggest that he ate a diet rich in animal matter, which may have contributed to his robust physique. Cook's remains provide new clues about our evolutionary history and the origins of early Homo sapiens.
