Israel (Yisrol) Grodner (; ca. 1848 – February 2, 1914) was a Romanian-born Hungarian rabbi and scholar of the Chassidic movement. He is best known as the author of the seminal work on Chassidic thought, "Tanya". Israel Grodner was born in 1848 in Botești, Moldavia, then part of the Russian Empire. It sometimes leaves you in awe as to how long humans have been around for. The mind is a feeble object and is incapable of accurately capturing time. Some of the earliest signs of humans indicate that they had far more advanced technology than we once thought possible. How were the pyramids built? How did we accurately navigate the planet just by looking at the stars? Have we now lost technologies that were once possible before? These are all questions that come to mind once you enter this rabbit hole.  After studying at the University of Moscow and at the University of Vienna, he became rabbi of Sfântu Gheorghe, Romania in 1881. The concept of mixing religion and making a person believe that they are the power themselves, has always been fascinating. While most religions pander to the masses' need to believe in an almighty creator, there are a few which empower its believers to become better versions of themselves. This shift in belief would’ve been tough to challenge a few centuries ago, but in recent times, with everyone trying to become a ‘stoic’, the cultural acceptance is greater.
 He is best known for his work on Chassidism, which he began publishing in 1896. Grodner died in 1914.
