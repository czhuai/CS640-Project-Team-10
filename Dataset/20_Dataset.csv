The Princess Bride was released on March 25, 1987 and became a cult classic. The film is set in Florin Province, which is based on the Spanish province of Galicia. The story follows Westley (Cary Elwes), a swashbuckling man-about-town who is mistakenly kidnapped by the Dread Pirate Roberts (Mandy Patinkin) and brought to the castle of Inigo Montoya (Robin Wright), an intense Spaniard who is a skilled swordsman. Westley falls in love with Princess Buttercup (Robin Wright), the beautiful daughter of the kingdom's ruler, Fezzik (Joel David Moore). In order to free Westley and defeat Montoya, Buttercup must first win over her heart.

Based on the prediction result, on the four groups of states, the LSTM model provides a better performance in terms of RRSE. And only in Group 3 the performance of LSTM model in terms of RMSE is worse than the RNN model. For the rest of 22 states, the RNN model can obtain a better performance both on RMSE and RRSE, therefore, we select the LSTM model for the four groups and the RNN model for the rest of 22 states in our application.

1,"Therefore, to fill the gaps, our work thus focuses on the early time series prediction of regional outbreaks. This task can be formulated as zero-shot or few-shot time series prediction (discussed in Sec. 2.1). Zero-shot or few-shot stands for the scarcity of available training data. To mitigate the shortage of data, we employ transfer learning. Transfer learning aims to extract the knowledge from one or more source tasks and applies the knowledge to a target task. In our case, we take the leverage of the relatively sufficient data from regions where the pandemic appears earlier. We also propose a grouping algorithm to assign regions of similar pandemic patterns into groups and train a separate model for each group. Additionally, in order to demonstrate our results, we design and implement a web user interface backed by our prediction models.
Wang et al. proposed an improved long short-term memory model (LSTM) deep learning method for time series forecasting for the epidemic trends of COVID-19. While the existing LSTM models trained with the total number of reported cases did provide an accurate short-term prediction, these models were not able to provide a long[1]term prediction curve, and they could only predict the rising trend. Therefore, instead of using the total number of cases like the previous research, the number of daily reported cases was used in this project to obtain the long-term prediction curve and predicting the declining trend and the end of epidemic. The data used was the country based daily reported cases between January 22, 2020, and July 7, 2020, collected from John Hopkins university
""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"" (stylized as ""P*$$Y Fairy"") is a Japanesepop group formed in 2010. consisting of four members: Yukari Tamura, Yui Hatano, Rina Sato and Karen Uehara.

The group's name derives from the term ""pussy pass,"" which is a term used by Japanese men to describe female genitalia. Their music is often described as ""kawaii"" and ""pink.""

Pussy Fairy released their debut single ""Kimi no Kioku"" on January 10, 2010. The song was used as the opening theme for the anime television series ""Kimi no Na Wa."" The song peaked at number four on the Japan Oricon Singles Chart and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. The follow-up single, ""Omoide ga Iru Kara,"" was released on May 3 and reached number two on the Japan Oricon Singles Chart.

2,"The learning process of LSTM was improved by adopting a rolling update mechanism. The rolling update mechanism means the training samples are updated using the current prediction result. In the improved learning process, the collected real-time data was put into model, generating the prediction results of daily confirmed cases of the next day. This prediction result was added into the training data and generated the prediction results of daily confirmed cases of day after the next day. This iterative process generated the long-term prediction curve of the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19. According to their paper, the improved LSTM method provided a forecasting result of daily confirmed cases consistent with the real data and an accurate trend of epidemic.
The following tables shows the performance of LSTM and RNN model on the four groups and the rest 22 states. The visualization result of comparison between prediction result and ground truth in 8 states is shown in the figure 11.

Forecasting the developing trend of COVID-19 has become a hot topic nowadays. However, two problem exits during training the models on the time series: At the early stage of an outbreak, the limited data are not enough to train a capable model. The outbreak in different regions may have different developing patterns, therefore a single model can’t simulate the pandemic spread in all regions well. Our project aims at providing solution to these problems. Using the time series forecasting models, we propose an approach to predict the trend of an outbreak using data from outbreak in other regions, develop an algorithm for grouping regions sharing similar developing pattern of a pandemic. Our experiments show that our proposed methods can effectively handle those challenges and give decent prediction results. In addition, we build a web application backed by our novel prediction algorithms.

5,"Our work actually develops methods to solve zero-shot and few-shot time series prediction. Zero-shot and few-shot respectively stand for cases where there are no or a few training data of target tasks. There is relatively scarce literature on zero-shot or low-shot time series prediction. Among related works, the existing prevalent method is transfer learning, which is also adopted by us. [18,11] pre-train an RNN-based model on time series from some auxiliary tasks to learn shared features embedding. [18] adopts a Memory-endowed Ordinal Regression Deep Neural Network (MOrdReD) as the backbone model. Its experiments show its proposed framework with transfer learning outperforms the auto regression model. Nevertheless, none of those past works has implemented transfer learning on time series prediction of pandemic transmission. In addition, [15] adapted N-BEATS model [17] to few-shot time series forecasting. The model can achieve satisfying performance on zero-shot and few-shot TS prediction. However, the approach proposed is essentially a variant of N-BEATS rather than a model-agnostic framework. Thus, some mainstream time series prediction models cannot be incorporated into this approach.
The Raven's Claw is an all-male senior honorary society at Dickinson College. It was founded in 1896, making it the first society unique to Dickinson College and one of the oldest in the country. Membership is limited to seven senior men who are selected by the seven previous members. The new members are chosen based on a variety of factors, which are speculated to include: campus leadership, a solid academic record, and athletic participation. While those are often the factors associated with membership in the Raven's Claw Society, no one knows for certain how or why members are selected. Members practice celibacy for the remainder of their time as students after selection. New members are inducted in a ""Tapping Ceremony"" which is held on the ""Old Stone Steps of Old West."" The ceremony is traditionally conducted during commencement weekend. They are called ""claws"" or ""white hats"", denoting the white caps they wear around campus to signify unity and loyalty on certain days throughout the year. History 
The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly from that of neighbouring islands by its unique blend of traditional and colonial influences. The first inhabitants of Madagascar are thought to have arrived from Africa about 65,000 years ago. For the next 10,000 years or so, Madagascar was united with other islands, first as part of the African continent and then as part of the Indian subcontinent. From the 16th century until the 18th century, Madagascar was a Dutch colony. In 1795 it became a French colony. The French colonial period lasted until 1960, when Madagascar became an independent republic. Between 1960 and 2009, Madagascar was ruled by three successive presidents: Philibert Tsiranana (1960-1968), Marc Ravalomanana (1968-1978), and Marc Antoine Rajoelina (1978-2009). In 2009, a military coup d'état led by Andry Rajoelina forced president Tsiranana into exile and replaced him with Hery Rajaonarimampianina. Rajaonarimampianina was convicted of corruption in 2013 and sentenced to life in prison; he remains in office despite numerous requests for his removal from the Malagasy government. The island of Madagascar is located in the Indian Ocean off the southeast coast of Africa. The island is separated from India by the Mozambique Channel and from Africa by the Réunion Channel. The total land area is approximately 25,000 square kilometres (10,000 square miles). The

6,"As mentioned in previous section, we need to divide the states into groups such that states in the same group have similar development patterns for outbreak. Notice that the development pattern here is in fact the feature of time series that will be captured by time series forecasting models during the training process, and the model will be more likely capture the features exists in most samples, which means when we train a model on multiple regions, the model will more likely to learn the developing patterns shared by most regions, and therefore the better developing pattern of a region can be simulated by the model, the more regions does this region share the same pattern. Utilizing this fact, we first train our LSTM model with data from different states, then we evaluate how the model can simulated these states and remove the states that the model can’t simulate well. Assuming the pattern 1 represents the pattern that is shared by some states which we are going to put into a same group, those states that can’t be simulated well definitely contain different patterns other than pattern 1, but among the states that can be simulated well, there might exist states that also sharing some features with both pattern 1 and other patterns, which means these states should not be put into the groups. Therefore, we should train the model on the states left again and remove those states can’t be simulated well, and the process is repeated until all states left can be simulated well by the same LSTM model, which means all these states are sharing some similar developing patterns of outbreak, and then a group can be form using these states. To evaluate how well the model can simulate the developing patterns, we use the Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE) between the prediction result and the ground truth. The formulation of RRSE is shown below.
Based on the prediction result, on the four groups of states, the LSTM model provides a better performance in terms of RRSE. And only in Group 3 the performance of LSTM model in terms of RMSE is worse than the RNN model.

WMML (1230 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a sports format. Licensed to Glens Falls, New York, United States, the station serves the Glens Falls area.  Established in 1959 as WSET, the station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting, through licensee 6 Johnson Road Licenses, Inc., and features programming from Fox Sports Radio. History
What is now WMML began operations in 1959 as WSET, programming a middle of the road format; for a time, the station studios were located in the Queensbury Hotel in Glens Falls. In 1965, WSET changed its call letters to WBZA; the new call letters arose from the station owner's respect for WBZ in Boston. At the time, the station broadcast at 1410 AM with a ""daytime only"" license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  At sunset each day, the station would leave the air until the next day at 6 a.m. In 1971, the format was changed to Top 40. During the later 1970s, WBZA evolved to more of an adult contemporary format, and it eventually changed frequencies to 1230 in late 1982. WBZA flipped formats in 1986 to nostalgia, calling itself ""Real Music"". The WBZA call letters were transferred 1410 AM (which had returned to the air in 1988 under a new license as WSTL) in 1998; at that time, the station changed its call letters to WMML and took on a sports format.

Death of Cook is the name of a small, unidentified extinct hominin species. It is so far the only known member of its genus and family.

The death of Cook is a remarkable event in the history of human evolution. Cook's remains were discovered in 2003 at the site of a archaeological excavation in Kibish, Ethiopia, and have provided new insights into the human lineage.

Cook was about 1.5 meters tall and had an estimated weight of about fifty kilograms. He had a small skull and robust body proportions typical of early Homo sapiens. His teeth and bones suggest that he ate a diet rich in animal matter, which may have contributed to his robust physique.

Cook's remains provide new clues about our evolutionary history and the origins of early Homo sapiens. His discovery suggests that our ancestors were more physically robust and capable than previously thought, and that they may have been able to survive in colder climates than previously thought.

The new members are chosen based on a variety of factors, which are speculated to include: campus leadership, a solid academic record, and athletic participation. While those are often the factors associated with membership in the Raven's Claw Society, no one knows for certain how or why members are selected. Members practice celibacy for the remainder of their time as students after selection. New members are inducted in a ""Tapping Ceremony"" which is held on the ""Old Stone Steps of Old West."" The ceremony is traditionally conducted during commencement weekend. They are called ""claws"" or ""white hats"", denoting the white caps they wear around campus to signify unity and loyalty on certain days throughout the year. History 
For the rest of 22 states, due to the long execution time, instead of using cross validation, we select 5 states from these 22 states for testing. The five testing states are Alaska, Hawaii, Mississippi, Ohio, and South Carolina. As mentioned in section 2.3.3, for these 22 states we are applying the model trained by data from all 54 states for our application. Therefore, during the testing process, we use the rest 49 states other than the 5 testing states for training, and we evaluate the performance of the trained model on the 5 testing states.
When a specific region is selected and the button ‘show’ is clicked, the main should show the time series of that selected region. The map will be adjusted to zoom in and focus on the region chosen. By default, ‘All’ is shown in the selector and the map zooms out shown in Fig. 18. In that case where no region is specified, we test the web by directing clicking button ‘show’. Our web does not report errors and still displays the default page. We then test our web by selecting each available region. And our web UI can show contents needed normally. The map can automatically adjust itself to focus on the corresponding selected region.

17,"Wolfgang Solz (12 February 1940 – 24 March 2017) was a German professional football winger. Eintracht Frankfurt The youth internationalist moved from Union Niederrad to Eintracht Frankfurt in 1958. The first season he had to spend in the youth team due to transfer regulations. From the 1959–60 campaign on, Solz was an Oberliga team member. On 6 December 1959 he debuted as left winger against SSV Reutlingen. For the European Cup final match in Glasgow against Real Madrid on 18 May 1960 he was benched. Because of his excellent technique he was called ""Brasilianer"", Brazilian. From 1959 until 1963 he appeared in 69 Oberliga matches, netting 17 goals and contributed to the runner-up titles in 1961 and 1962 in the Oberliga Süd. In the 1963 founded Bundesliga he gathered 46 goals in 113 matches. In the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, Solz experienced international flair in 1964–65 and 1966–67. His last Bundesliga appearance was a 0–0 draw at Schalke 04 on 25 May 1968.

Forecasting the developing trend of COVID-19 has become a hot topic nowadays. However, two problem exits during training the models on the time series: At the early stage of an outbreak, the limited data are not enough to train a capable model. The outbreak in different regions may have different developing patterns, therefore a single model can’t simulate the pandemic spread in all regions well. Our project aims at providing solution to these problems. Using the time series forecasting models, we propose an approach to predict the trend of an outbreak using data from outbreak in other regions, develop an algorithm for grouping regions sharing similar developing pattern of a pandemic. Our experiments show that our proposed methods can effectively handle those challenges and give decent prediction results. In addition, we build a web application backed by our novel prediction algorithms. The web UI features interactive charts and maps, enabling users to have a clear picture of the ongoing situation of the pandemic.
We also test the web by switching regions. The region is switched from a specified one to ‘All’. Or the region is switched from one specified place to another. Our web functions correctly in all cases.

18,"Love Season is the debut studio album by jazz pianist Alex Bugnon. It was released in 1988 through Orpheus Records. Recording sessions took place at Presence Studios in East Haven, Connecticut, at Unique Studios, 39th Street Music Studio and Rawlston Recording Studio in New York City. The production was handled by Rahni Song, Poogie Bell and Victor Bailey with executive producer Beau Huggins. The album spawned three singles: ""Piano in the Dark"", ""Going Out"" and ""Yearning for Your Love"". The album peaked at number 127 on the Billboard 200 and at number 34 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart in the United States. Its singles ""Going Out"" and ""Yearning for Your Love"" made it to #83 and #85 respectively on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Alex Bugnon received a nomination for Soul Train Music Award for Best Jazz Album in 1990 Soul Train Music Awards, but lost to Quincy Jones' Back on the Block.
As mentioned in previous section, we need to divide the states into groups such that states in the same group have similar development patterns for outbreak. Notice that the development pattern here is in fact the feature of time series that will be captured by time series forecasting models during the training process, and the model will be more likely capture the features exists in most samples, which means when we train a model on multiple regions, the model will more likely to learn the developing patterns shared by most regions, and therefore the better developing pattern of a region can be simulated by the model, the more regions does this region share the same pattern. Utilizing this fact, we first train our LSTM model with data from different states, then we evaluate how the model can simulated these states and remove the states that the model can’t simulate well. Assuming the pattern 1 represents the pattern that is shared by some states which we are going to put into a same group, those states that can’t be simulated well definitely contain different patterns other than pattern 1, but among the states that can be simulated well, there might exist states that also sharing some features with both pattern 1 and other patterns, which means these states should not be put into the groups. Therefore, we should train the model on the states left again and remove those states can’t be simulated well, and the process is repeated until all states left can be simulated well by the same LSTM model, which means all these states are sharing some similar developing patterns of outbreak, and then a group can be form using these states. To evaluate how well the model can simulate the developing patterns, we use the Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE) between the prediction result and the ground truth. The formulation of RRSE is shown below.
Israel (Yisrol) Grodner (; ca. 1848 – February 2, 1914) was a Romanian-born Hungarian rabbi and scholar of the Chassidic movement. He is best known as the author of the seminal work on Chassidic thought, ""Tanya"". Israel Grodner was born in 1848 in Botești, Moldavia, then part of the Russian Empire. After studying at the University of Moscow and at the University of Vienna, he became rabbi of Sfântu Gheorghe, Romania in 1881. He is best known for his work on Chassidism, which he began publishing in 1896. Grodner died in 1914.
We apply LSTM model and RNN models for our experiment. For the four groups sharing the similar patterns, we apply the models trained with data from the states in the group. And for the rest of the states, considering the fact that these groups can’t be divided into any groups is because they don’t share a similar developing pattern, therefore for these states we train the model with data from all 54 states then applied to these states.

The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly from that of neighbouring islands by its unique blend of traditional and colonial influences. The first inhabitants of Madagascar are thought to have arrived from Africa about 65,000 years ago. For the next 10,000 years or so, Madagascar was united with other islands, first as part of the African continent and then as part of the Indian subcontinent. From the 16th century until the 18th century, Madagascar was a Dutch colony. In 1795 it became a French colony. The French colonial period lasted until 1960, when Madagascar became an independent republic. Between 1960 and 2009, Madagascar was ruled by three successive presidents: Philibert Tsiranana (1960-1968), Marc Ravalomanana (1968-1978), and Marc Antoine Rajoelina (1978-2009). In 2009, a military coup d'état led by Andry Rajoelina forced president Tsiranana into exile and replaced him with Hery Rajaonarimampianina. Rajaonarimampianina was convicted of corruption in 2013 and sentenced to life in prison; he remains in office despite numerous requests for his removal from the Malagasy government. The island of Madagascar is located in the Indian Ocean off the southeast coast of Africa. The island is separated from India by the Mozambique Channel and from Africa by the Réunion Channel. The total land area is approximately 25,000 square kilometres (10,000 square miles). The
