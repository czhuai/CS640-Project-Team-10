Actually now it turns out I need 300 more words, as we are creating more documents with different needs. I am creating documents with 70-100% originality, most of the wikipedia plus GPT introductions are 300 words long, so I’ll need 700 words of original text to create 70% original documents. I’ll probably create one each of 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% and two of 100% originality with varying lengths. For 70%-95% originality, I’ll interleave the human text for more variation. So for the new 300 words I thought I’ll describe my team’s latest discussions regarding the project and how we finally decided to proceed with the project. We are going to generate 5 plagiarism scores for each document, each from 2 human plagiarism checkers, detectGPT, GPTZero and the OpenAI Text Classifier respectively. These scores will be passed to a neural network as input, and the output will be an originality score as the ratio of length of original text to length of total text. Both, the training and testing data will be subsets of the GPT-wiki-intro dataset. I am actually feeling very sleepy right now, given that I have been up since 4 AM and now it’s 10:30 PM, but I have to upload these 8 documents before sleeping, so that tomorrow I can only focus on the IVC assignment tomorrow onwards. I found new songs to listen to today which is a nice thing. But now I think I have to conclude this passage as I am approaching around 700 words and I think that should be enough for the project’s preliminary results. So yeah I hereby conclude my thoughts and this is going to be the last entence I type. Or maybe not. But yeah this is the last sentence most probably.
