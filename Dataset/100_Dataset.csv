Qasr Ibrahim (Ibrahim Palace) is a historical castle and fort that is located in the north of Alqoat neighborhood, Hofuf, Al-Ahsa, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. Besides, it is called the dome Palace, AlQoat Palace or Ibrahim Castle. Ibrahim palace is the main architectural heritage from the Ottoman period of Al-Hofuf that was a Turkish military barracks. After that, the palace was taken and seized by King Abdul-Aziz Al Saud in April 13, 1913 (5th of First Jumada 1331 AH). The palace was constructed with a mosque that has a dome in 1555 (963 AH). During the next century, the palace was enlarged into a castle, prison and Turkish bath. In 2019, the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage has announced that the procedures of renovation of all parts of the palace have finished. This restoration process included rebuilding the fallen parts, painting the buildings and preparing a main square for the tourism activities and festivals.
Jai Bhim  is a 2021 Indian action film directed by Sajid Khan and produced by Fox Star Studios. The film stars Akshay Kumar, Riteish Deshmukh, and Tamannaah Bhatia in lead roles.

The story is set in the fictional town of Jai Bhim. It follows Bhim (Akshay Kumar), a humble taxi driver who is wrongly accused of a crime he did not commit, and his quest to clear his name and restore justice to his town. 

Development on the film began in early 2019, with Khan directing from a screenplay he wrote himself. Principal photography began in November that year in Mumbai and continued in other parts of Maharashtra until May 2020. The film was shot using anamorphic lenses, to give it a ""grittier"" look.

Jai Bhim was released worldwide on 3 June 2021, to generally positive reviews from critics. It grossed over $120 million worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time.
Our trained time series forecasting models are the backend for the prediction function, which is taking the user uploaded data from frontend as input and return the required prediction result. We divided the states into five groups, and each group is assigned with one model. In the project, we compare the performance of RNN and LSTM models on each group and select the better one. The RNN model can remember the previous input using its internal memory, which gives it the capability of capturing the pattern of time series. Since our goal is to predict the outbreak’s development at its early stage, the RNN model’s capability draws our attention. However, the RNN model may encounter the vanishing gradient problem which can result in difficulties in updating the parameters of model. Therefore, we also employ LSTM in our experiment, a model commonly used in processing time series that can solve the vanishing gradient problem. The structures of RNN and LSTM models we use are shown in the following figure.

Established in 1959 as WSET, the station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting, through licensee 6 Johnson Road Licenses, Inc., and features programming from Fox Sports Radio. History
What is now WMML began operations in 1959 as WSET, programming a middle of the road format; for a time, the station studios were located in the Queensbury Hotel in Glens Falls. In 1965, WSET changed its call letters to WBZA; the new call letters arose from the station owner's respect for WBZ in Boston. At the time, the station broadcast at 1410 AM with a ""daytime only"" license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  At sunset each day, the station would leave the air until the next day at 6 a.m. In 1971, the format was changed to Top 40. During the later 1970s, WBZA evolved to more of an adult contemporary format, and it eventually changed frequencies to 1230 in late 1982. WBZA flipped formats in 1986 to nostalgia, calling itself ""Real Music"". The WBZA call letters were transferred 1410 AM (which had returned to the air in 1988 under a new license as WSTL) in 1998; at that time, the station changed its call letters to WMML and took on a sports format.

We have formed 4 groups of states, and there are 22 states left which can’t be divided into any groups. The following tables show the information of each group. Notice that at this stage we are only splitting the states into groups instead of testing the models, the RRSE here is obtained by evaluating the prediction result on training dataset which is all states in each group.
When doing prediction for a certain region, the input number is required to be larger than 14. Because our model is trained to predict the future time series with past 14-day data points. In that case, we test our web with input from 0 to 13. And all cases are handled by returning messages to advice users to update their inputs (see Fig. 14). However, if no regions are selected to conduct prediction, our web is programmed to show the content normally.
In mathematics, specifically differential calculus, the inverse function theorem gives a sufficient condition for a function to be invertible in a neighborhood of a point in its domain: namely, that its derivative is continuous and non-zero at the point. The theorem also gives a formula for the derivative of the inverse function. In multivariable calculus, this theorem can be generalized to any continuously differentiable, vector-valued function whose Jacobian determinant is nonzero at a point in its domain, giving a formula for the Jacobian matrix of the inverse. There are also versions of the inverse function theorem for complex holomorphic functions, for differentiable maps between manifolds, for differentiable functions between Banach spaces, and so forth. Statement For functions of a single variable, the theorem states that if is a continuously differentiable function with nonzero derivative at the point ; then is invertible in a neighborhood of , the inverse is continuously differentiable, and the derivative of the inverse function at is the reciprocal of the derivative of at :

6,"Forecasting the developing trend of COVID-19 has become a hot topic nowadays. However, two problem exits during training the models on the time series: At the early stage of an outbreak, the limited data are not enough to train a capable model. The outbreak in different regions may have different developing patterns, therefore a single model can’t simulate the pandemic spread in all regions well. Our project aims at providing solution to these problems. Using the time series forecasting models, we propose an approach to predict the trend of an outbreak using data from outbreak in other regions, develop an algorithm for grouping regions sharing similar developing pattern of a pandemic. Our experiments show that our proposed methods can effectively handle those challenges and give decent prediction results. In addition, we build a web application backed by our novel prediction algorithms. The web UI features interactive charts and maps, enabling users to have a clear picture of the ongoing situation of the pandemic.

FORGE’s Mission FORGE aims to build upon the capacity of African refugees to cultivate empowered communities and to create the conditions for peace and prosperity in their countries. FORGE believes that individuals affected by war are a key factor to breaking the cycle of war and poverty in Africa. Instead of providing relief work for refugees, FORGE aims at providing education and training to refugees in order to empower them with greater economic and leadership capacity. There are five main project areas that FORGE is now working on: Education, Economic Development, Health Education, Women’s Empowerment and Community Enrichment.
The Borderland series of urban fantasy novels and stories were created for teenage readers by author Terri Windling. Most of the series is set in Bordertown, a dystopian city near the border between ""the Elflands"" and ""The World"". The series consists of five anthologies and three novels. The series has spawned fan groups, gaming groups, costumed events (such as the Borderzone parties in Los Angeles), and was discussed in The Fence and the River: Culture and Politics at the US-Mexico Border by Claire F. Fox. Bordertown is the name of the shared universe created by Terri Windling, and a fictional place within that universe. The premise of the Borderland books is that the ""Elflands"" - a realm of magic populated by post-Tolkien elves have ""returned"" to ""The World"". The region of juxtaposition of the Elflands and the World includes Bordertown or ""B-Town"", and the ""Borderlands"" which lie between Bordertown and the World.  In the liminal environment of Bordertown and its environs, neither magic nor technology functions ""normally"", and unpredictable combinations of the two may emerge.

In computer science and mathematics, a full employment theorem is a theorem stating that for any given set of available resources, there exists a unique unemployment equilibrium in which there are no unemployed people.

The full employment theorem is a result of the theory of market equilibrium and was first proposed by Pareto in 1895. The theorem states that if the market has the ability to create full employment, then there will be no unemployment.

There are a few conditions that must be met for the theorem to hold:
1) There must be enough resources available to meet demand.
2) The market must be able to create jobs at the same rate as people enter and leave the workforce.
3) The rate at which jobs are created must be equal to the rate at which people want to work.

The goal of our project is to forecast the development of an outbreak within third and fourth weeks based on the first two weeks, therefore, we are only interested in the front portion instead of the whole time series. Notice that the dataset we obtained is start from the day when first cases is reported in the whole United States, while in different states the outbreak started at different time, which will result in a series of 0 exists before the start of outbreak. Therefore, in terms of sampling, for each state, we start from the first day when the number of cases reported was increasing in its next three days so that all samples contain data of the first outbreak in the state. The first 35 days start from the start of outbreak in each states are used, and they are divided into 8 samples where each sample contains 14 days’ data for input and the next 14 days’ data for output comparison. The dataset we obtained records the cumulative number of cases, however, during the early experiment we noticed that when using daily cumulative number of cases for training, the prediction results for next 14 days may give the decrease of cumulative number of cases during some periods, which is impossible at the early stage of pandemic. Therefore, instead of using the daily cumulative number of cases directly, we use the number of daily reported new cases in our project.

WMML (1230 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a sports format. Licensed to Glens Falls, New York, United States, the station serves the Glens Falls area.  Established in 1959 as WSET, the station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting, through licensee 6 Johnson Road Licenses, Inc., and features programming from Fox Sports Radio. History
What is now WMML began operations in 1959 as WSET, programming a middle of the road format; for a time, the station studios were located in the Queensbury Hotel in Glens Falls. In 1965, WSET changed its call letters to WBZA; the new call letters arose from the station owner's respect for WBZ in Boston. At the time, the station broadcast at 1410 AM with a ""daytime only"" license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  At sunset each day, the station would leave the air until the next day at 6 a.m. In 1971, the format was changed to Top 40. During the later 1970s, WBZA evolved to more of an adult contemporary format, and it eventually changed frequencies to 1230 in late 1982. WBZA flipped formats in 1986 to nostalgia, calling itself ""Real Music"". The WBZA call letters were transferred 1410 AM (which had returned to the air in 1988 under a new license as WSTL) in 1998; at that time, the station changed its call letters to WMML and took on a sports format.

Qasr Ibrahim (Ibrahim Palace) is a historical palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It is located on the Fontanka River, southeast of the Winter Palace. 

The construction of the palace began in 1754 on the orders of Empress Elizabeth I for her son, Peter III. The palace was built as a residence for the imperial family and remained their primary residence until 1918. From 1918 to 1924 it served as the official residence of the Russian provisional government during the Russian Revolution. 

The palace has been used as a museum since 1924 and is now part of the State Hermitage Museum.
Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters is a 2013 book by American environmental historian Kate Brown. The book is a comparative history of the cities of Richland, in the northwest United States adjacent to the U.S. Department of Energy Hanford Site plutonium production area, and Ozersk, in Russia's southern Ural mountain region. These two cities were home to the world's first plutonium production sites, and in Plutopia Brown charts the environmental and social impacts of those sites on the residents of and the environment surrounding the two cities. Brown argues that the demands of plutonium production – both the danger of the physical process and the secrecy required in the Cold War context – led both US and Soviet officials to create ""Plutopias,"" ideal communities to placate resident families in exchange for their cooperation and control over their bodies. This entailed creating significant state-run welfare programs along with high levels of consumerism in both places. However, each city witnessed what Brown terms ""slow-motion disasters"" via the slow, and usually controlled, release of high levels of radiation into their surrounding environments. Awards Plutopia was awarded the 2014 George Perkins Marsh Prize from the American Society for Environmental History (ASEH) as the best book in environmental history and the 2014 Ellis W. Hawley Prize from the Organization of American Historians (OAH). It was also awarded the 2015 John H. Dunning Prize from the American Historical Association as the best book in American history.

In computer science and mathematics, a full employment theorem is a term used, often humorously, to refer to a theorem which states that no algorithm can optimally perform a particular task done by some class of professionals. The name arises because such a theorem ensures that there is endless scope to keep discovering new techniques to improve the way at least some specific task is done. For example, the full employment theorem for compiler writers states that there is no such thing as a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler, as such a proof for the compiler would have to detect non-terminating computations and reduce them to a one-instruction infinite loop. Thus, the existence of a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler would imply a solution to the halting problem, which cannot exist. This also implies that there may always be a better compiler since the proof that one has the best compiler cannot exist. Therefore, compiler writers will always be able to speculate that they have something to improve. A similar example in practical computer science is the idea of no free lunch in search and optimization, which states that no efficient general-purpose solver can exist, and hence there will always be some particular problem whose best known solution might be improved.

Wang et al. proposed an improved long short-term memory model (LSTM) deep learning method for time series forecasting for the epidemic trends of COVID-19. While the existing LSTM models trained with the total number of reported cases did provide an accurate short-term prediction, these models were not able to provide a long[1]term prediction curve, and they could only predict the rising trend. Therefore, instead of using the total number of cases like the previous research, the number of daily reported cases was used in this project to obtain the long-term prediction curve and predicting the declining trend and the end of epidemic.

Therefore, this work is motivated to model the spread of COVID-19, which can help governments to manage public policies and arrange medical resources in order to better contain the coronavirus. More specifically, our project implements time series (TS) prediction of daily infected cases. Time series forecasting has been widely studied, which aims at making scientific predictions based on historical time stamped data. Several works have also been conducted on the application to the pandemic forecasting. Among those works, the recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture as a deep-learning model is widely adopted, especially long short-term memory (LSTM). However, those works on time series prediction are faced with two critical challenges: (1) At the early stage of a regional outbreak, there may not be enough historical data to train a capable deep learning model. (2) The outbreak in different regions may have different patterns of development, therefore it may be difficult for a single prediction model to learn and simulate the pandemic spread in all regions.

In 781 games played, Roberts batted .234 with 588 hits during a ten-season minor league playing career.
Israel (Yisrol) Grodner (; ca. 1848 – 1887) was one of the founding performers in Yiddish theater. A Lithuanian Jew who moved at the age of 16 to Berdichev, Ukraine, Russian Empire, the Broder singer and actor was in Iaşi, Romania in 1876 when Abraham Goldfaden recruited him as the first actor for what became the first professional Yiddish theater troupe. Jacob Adler remarks that as the only Lithuanian Jew in the early years of Yiddish theater, he deliberately spoke a different dialect of Yiddish on stage so that it would blend better with the other actors. (The Yiddish of Lithuania differed from that of Ukraine and Romania.) Although his early performances with Goldfaden are usually considered the start of professional Yiddish-language theater, as a Broder singer Grodner was already something of an actor, and he had already participated in an 1873 concert in Odessa, Ukraine in which he and other Broder singers sang songs (including some of Goldfaden's) and improvised comic material between songs that was very similar to Goldfaden's early, highly improvised, comic musical plays. Actor Jacob Adler, already a big fan of the highly regarded Russian language theater in Odessa at that time, and who saw Grodner perform in taverns and restaurants, indicates in his memoir the strong impression Grodner made on him for how well he portrayed his characters. Lulla Rosenfeld writes that Grodner was known in Odessa as ""Srolikl Papirosnik"" (from papiros, cigarette) because he always had a cigarette dangling from his lip.
The learning process of LSTM was improved by adopting a rolling update mechanism. The rolling update mechanism means the training samples are updated using the current prediction result. In the improved learning process, the collected real-time data was put into model, generating the prediction results of daily confirmed cases of the next day. This prediction result was added into the training data and generated the prediction results of daily confirmed cases of day after the next day. This iterative process generated the long-term prediction curve of the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19. According to their paper, the improved LSTM method provided a forecasting result of daily confirmed cases consistent with the real data and an accurate trend of epidemic.
In computer science and mathematics, a full employment theorem is a theorem stating that for any given set of available resources, there exists a unique unemployment equilibrium in which there are no unemployed people.

The full employment theorem is a result of the theory of market equilibrium and was first proposed by Pareto in 1895. The theorem states that if the market has the ability to create full employment, then there will be no unemployment.

There are a few conditions that must be met for the theorem to hold:
1) There must be enough resources available to meet demand.
2) The market must be able to create jobs at the same rate as people enter and leave the workforce.
3) The rate at which jobs are created must be equal to the rate at which people want to work.

Melvin Henry Roberts (January 18, 1943 – October 17, 1995) was an American professional baseball player. A catcher, he played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles, Cincinnati Reds, and Boston Red Sox from 1966 to 1978. Roberts was born in Memphis, Tennessee and attended Booker T. Washington High School in Memphis. He played college baseball for the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss), where he was a First Team All-American in 1964. The following year, he was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the first round of the 1965 MLB draft. Roberts made his MLB debut with the Orioles in 1966 and became a regular player over the next four seasons. He was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in 1976 and then to the Boston Red Sox in 1978. In 1979, he was named an All-Star for the first time. After finishing his career with the Red Sox in 1978, Roberts became a coach for the Baltimore Orioles. He died of cancer at age 50 in 1995.
Therefore, this work is motivated to model the spread of COVID-19, which can help governments to manage public policies and arrange medical resources in order to better contain the coronavirus. More specifically, our project implements time series (TS) prediction of daily infected cases. Time series forecasting has been widely studied, which aims at making scientific predictions based on historical time stamped data. Several works have also been conducted on the application to the pandemic forecasting. Among those works, the recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture as a deep-learning model is widely adopted, especially long short-term memory (LSTM). However, those works on time series prediction are faced with two critical challenges: (1) At the early stage of a regional outbreak, there may not be enough historical data to train a capable deep learning model. (2) The outbreak in different regions may have different patterns of development, therefore it may be difficult for a single prediction model to learn and simulate the pandemic spread in all regions.

When her adopted sister, Tomi, becomes ill, Sumi finds that no doctors will help her as they are poor and no one is willing to give her money for medicine to save Tomi. Then as Sumi is crying on the road a handsome man gives her a handkerchief and some money, telling her to stop crying as smiles beckon happiness into her life before disappearing. Later a debt collector turns up at Sumi's house demanding 2000 yen. Eisuke is nowhere to be found and it is revealed that he had been making advances on the debt collector's wife. The man says that he will take away all of Sumi's younger siblings and sell them into slavery. Desperate to save her siblings, Sumi goes to the red light district in an attempt to raise the money in one night. Just when she thinks there's no more hope, a man named Soichiro Ashida appears and says that he will buy her. Sumi goes with him only to find that he was paying her to marry him! They immediately go to the church and afterwards he says that he'll pay for anything she could possibly want, but she has to marry him and not fall for him and that he will never love her. Sumi agrees and they get married.

Our work actually develops methods to solve zero-shot and few-shot time series prediction. Zero-shot and few-shot respectively stand for cases where there are no or a few training data of target tasks. There is relatively scarce literature on zero-shot or low-shot time series prediction. Among related works, the existing prevalent method is transfer learning, which is also adopted by us. [18,11] pre-train an RNN-based model on time series from some auxiliary tasks to learn shared features embedding. [18] adopts a Memory-endowed Ordinal Regression Deep Neural Network (MOrdReD) as the backbone model. Its experiments show its proposed framework with transfer learning outperforms the auto regression model. Nevertheless, none of those past works has implemented transfer learning on time series prediction of pandemic transmission. In addition, [15] adapted N-BEATS model [17] to few-shot time series forecasting. The model can achieve satisfying performance on zero-shot and few-shot TS prediction. However, the approach proposed is essentially a variant of N-BEATS rather than a model-agnostic framework. Thus, some mainstream time series prediction models cannot be incorporated into this approach.

Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups indigenous to the Maluku Islands, also called the Moluccas and historically known as the Spice Islands, which as a region has been annexed by Indonesia since the end of 1950. As such, ""Moluccans"" is used as a blanket term for the various ethnic and linguistic groups native to the islands. The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Austronesian and Melanesian in origin. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population in terms of linguistics and other areas, around 2000 BCE due to extensive trade, making Malayo-Polynesian creole languages the lingua franca in most of the region. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences due to colonization, marriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century. Moluccans are predominantly Christian like many other Melanesians, but Muslim villages are also present. Despite religious differences, all groups share strong cultural bonds and a sense of common identity, such as through Adat, Pela and Bongso traditions. Music is also a binding factor, playing an important role in the cultural identity. Moluccans historically tend to be a musically gifted people, excelling in creative areas such as singing and sports. In recognition, the Moluccan capital city of Ambon was awarded the official status of City of Music by UNESCO in 2019.

Instead of requesting the service of Google Maps platform at running time, we obtain all geographical data needed in advance and store them into a local file. Then our backend can directly read data locally. In that way, a great amount of processing time will be saved at running time and our web UI will be more responsive. Then given the latitudes and longitudes of cities, csv files recording pandemic situation of each city will be read to extract daily infected cases. Then we can have a data frame storing the name of a city, its geographical location and corresponding time series of infected cases. Based on the processed data, we take advantage of a library called pydeck to generate a map which marks each city with orange dots. We customize the map by programming the size of dots to change along with the number of infected cases in that city. Then we can use pre-defined function of Streamlit to display the map on the webpage.

As she investigates, she discovers that the Fae are using humans as pawns in a larger game, and she must fight to protect her friends and avert a Fae invasion of her home town.

The Borderland series has been praised for its well-developed characters and its intricate plot. Fans of urban fantasy novels are sure to enjoy the series, which is suitable for all ages.
In mathematics, specifically differential calculus, the inverse function theorem gives a sufficient condition for a function to be invertible in a neighborhood of a point in its domain: namely, that its derivative is continuous and non-zero at the point. The theorem also gives a formula for the derivative of the inverse function. In multivariable calculus, this theorem can be generalized to any continuously differentiable, vector-valued function whose Jacobian determinant is nonzero at a point in its domain, giving a formula for the Jacobian matrix of the inverse. There are also versions of the inverse function theorem for complex holomorphic functions, for differentiable maps between manifolds, for differentiable functions between Banach spaces, and so forth. Statement For functions of a single variable, the theorem states that if is a continuously differentiable function with nonzero derivative at the point ; then is invertible in a neighborhood of , the inverse is continuously differentiable, and the derivative of the inverse function at is the reciprocal of the derivative of at :

33,"Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters is a 2013 book by American environmental historian Kate Brown. The book is a comparative history of the cities of Richland, in the northwest United States adjacent to the U.S. Department of Energy Hanford Site plutonium production area, and Ozersk, in Russia's southern Ural mountain region. These two cities were home to the world's first plutonium production sites, and in Plutopia Brown charts the environmental and social impacts of those sites on the residents of and the environment surrounding the two cities. Brown argues that the demands of plutonium production – both the danger of the physical process and the secrecy required in the Cold War context – led both US and Soviet officials to create ""Plutopias,"" ideal communities to placate resident families in exchange for their cooperation and control over their bodies. This entailed creating significant state-run welfare programs along with high levels of consumerism in both places. However, each city witnessed what Brown terms ""slow-motion disasters"" via the slow, and usually controlled, release of high levels of radiation into their surrounding environments. Awards Plutopia was awarded the 2014 George Perkins Marsh Prize from the American Society for Environmental History (ASEH) as the best book in environmental history and the 2014 Ellis W. Hawley Prize from the Organization of American Historians (OAH). It was also awarded the 2015 John H. Dunning Prize from the American Historical Association as the best book in American history.

35,"Our work actually develops methods to solve zero-shot and few-shot time series prediction. Zero-shot and few-shot respectively stand for cases where there are no or a few training data of target tasks. There is relatively scarce literature on zero-shot or low-shot time series prediction. Among related works, the existing prevalent method is transfer learning, which is also adopted by us. [18,11] pre-train an RNN-based model on time series from some auxiliary tasks to learn shared features embedding. [18] adopts a Memory-endowed Ordinal Regression Deep Neural Network (MOrdReD) as the backbone model. Its experiments show its proposed framework with transfer learning outperforms the auto regression model. Nevertheless, none of those past works has implemented transfer learning on time series prediction of pandemic transmission. In addition, [15] adapted N-BEATS model [17] to few-shot time series forecasting. The model can achieve satisfying performance on zero-shot and few-shot TS prediction. However, the approach proposed is essentially a variant of N-BEATS rather than a model-agnostic framework. Thus, some mainstream time series prediction models cannot be incorporated into this approach.
The autoregressive made a wrong assumption that the number of new daily reported cases is stationary, resulting in a higher prediction result compared to the actual values. The random walk model trained with the log transformed daily report cases provided a well model of the dynamic of daily reported cases and an accurate short-term prediction of the number of daily reported cases. The growth curve model provides an estimation function for the cumulative number of SARS cases, while the variability exists.

36,"Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups indigenous to the Maluku Islands, also called the Moluccas and historically known as the Spice Islands, which as a region has been annexed by Indonesia since the end of 1950. As such, ""Moluccans"" is used as a blanket term for the various ethnic and linguistic groups native to the islands. The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Austronesian and Melanesian in origin. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population in terms of linguistics and other areas, around 2000 BCE due to extensive trade, making Malayo-Polynesian creole languages the lingua franca in most of the region. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences due to colonization, marriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century. Moluccans are predominantly Christian like many other Melanesians, but Muslim villages are also present. Despite religious differences, all groups share strong cultural bonds and a sense of common identity, such as through Adat, Pela and Bongso traditions. Music is also a binding factor, playing an important role in the cultural identity. Moluccans historically tend to be a musically gifted people, excelling in creative areas such as singing and sports. In recognition, the Moluccan capital city of Ambon was awarded the official status of City of Music by UNESCO in 2019.

The A5120 is an A-class road in Bedfordshire, linking the conjoined towns of Ampthill and Flitwick to Dunstable and, via the M1 motorway, Luton and London. It connects with the M1 at junction 12 in close proximity to the Toddington services. On its route from Ampthill to Dunstable, the A5120 serves Westoning, Harlington, Toddington and Tebworth. Unusually for an A-road, it does not meet another A-road at any point between its start on the A507 and its end on the A5. This would change if the A505 Dunstable North Bypass were to be built, however. When the A5120 meets the A5 in Dunstable, the latter is multiplexed with the A505 road. The road passes through the Houghton Regis area of Dunstable as it approaches the town from the north. The road actually continues past the A5, without its A5120 number, as an unclassified road, into the Beecroft industrial estate, where it meets the B489 road from Ivinghoe.

Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups inhabiting the Maluku Islands. The term ""Moluccan"" is an umbrella term that covers the various Austronesian and Papuan languages spoken on the islands. The largest group of Moluccans are the Tolo-speaking people. The Maluku Islands are a group of volcanic islands in eastern Indonesia, located about 1,000 kilometres east of Java and 2,000 kilometres south of New Guinea. The islands comprise over 700 islands, with a total land area of approximately 245,000 square kilometres. They have a population of around 1 million people, most of whom are Muslim. The largest island group is the Tolo-speaking region, which comprises over 60% of the population. The Moluccas were first explored by Europeans in 1512. Portuguese explorer João da Nova discovered Ternate and Tidore, while Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen discovered Halmahera and Bougainville. The Moluccas were later visited by Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. British explorer James Cook visited Ternate, Tidore, Halmahera, and Bougainville during his first voyage in 1770–71.
There are mainly two main tasks to handle, that is a real-time map reflecting the pandemic situation and collaboration with backend prediction model and data. For the first task, we utilize the Google geocoding API to obtain the latitude and longitude of a certain place. Instead of requesting the service of Google Maps platform at running time, we obtain all geographical data needed in advance and store them into a local file. Then our backend can directly read data locally. In that way, a great amount of processing time will be saved at running time and our web UI will be more responsive. Then given the latitudes and longitudes of cities, csv files recording pandemic situation of each city will be read to extract daily infected cases. Then we can have a data frame storing the name of a city, its geographical location and corresponding time series of infected cases. Based on the processed data, we take advantage of a library called pydeck to generate a map which marks each city with orange dots. We customize the map by programming the size of dots to change along with the number of infected cases in that city. Then we can use pre-defined function of Streamlit to display the map on the webpage.

Therefore, this work is motivated to model the spread of COVID-19, which can help governments to manage public policies and arrange medical resources in order to better contain the coronavirus. More specifically, our project implements time series (TS) prediction of daily infected cases. Time series forecasting has been widely studied, which aims at making scientific predictions based on historical time stamped data. Several works have also been conducted on the application to the pandemic forecasting. Among those works, the recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture as a deep-learning model is widely adopted, especially long short-term memory (LSTM). However, those works on time series prediction are faced with two critical challenges: (1) At the early stage of a regional outbreak, there may not be enough historical data to train a capable deep learning model. (2) The outbreak in different regions may have different patterns of development, therefore it may be difficult for a single prediction model to learn and simulate the pandemic spread in all regions.

43,"The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly by the early isolation of the landmass from the ancient supercontinent containing Africa and India, and by the island's late colonization by human settlers from the Sunda islands (Malay Archipelago) and from East Africa. 
These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of endemic plant and animal species, some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the government not allocating resources to help the growing population, causing many people to resort to harmful environmental practices as a way of survival.
Trade in the Indian Ocean at the time of first colonization of Madagascar was dominated by large ships, called Djong, coming from Java and Sumatra. Over the past two thousand years the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins including Austronesian, Bantu, Arab, South Asian, Chinese and European. The majority of the population of Madagascar today is a mixture of Austronesian and Bantu settlers. Despite popular belief, there has been no genetic input from Arabs or Indians, although one tribe, the Antemoro, claims descent from Somali Arab traders. European and Middle eastern paternal ancestry is also present.
Death of Cook is the name of several paintings depicting the 1779 death of the first European visitor to the Hawaiian Islands, Captain James Cook at Kealakekua Bay. Most of these paintings seem to go back to an original by John Cleveley the Younger, painted in 1784, although other versions, like that of John Webber, stood model for later copies too. Such artworks were reproduced in paint and engraving over the course of modern world history. The much more famous reproductions, like the one at the Honolulu Museum of Art (allegedly based on the Cleveley version), often depicted Cook as a peacemaker trying to stop the fighting between his sailors and the native Hawaiians that they had challenged in combat. However, in 2004, the original Cleveley painting was discovered in a private collection belonging to a family since 1851. James, Cleveley's brother was a member of Cook's crew, and the painting is said to concur with his drawings and eyewitness accounts. The original depicted Cook involved in hand-to-hand combat with the native Hawaiians. The discovery of the original painting has not changed the way most historians view Cook's relationship with the Hawaiians, as during his last voyage, Cook was reported by his contemporaries to have become irrationally violent. The original watercolour painting, together with three others in a series by Cleveley, was put up for auction by Christie's auction house in London in 2004. The lot of four paintings sold for £318,850 (USD 572,655).

It is a small section of the larger cemetery, under one acre in size, and is marked by two significant memorials: the Confederate Memorial and the memorial to Confederate Army General Patrick Cleburne, whose burial here is the only known place associated with his life.  The Cleburne memorial is a marble shaft  in height, topped by an urn with flames coming from its top.  The Confederate Memorial is a marble depiction of a soldier, mounted on a  granite shaft, surrounded by pyramids of cannonballs and inverted cannons.  The cemetery has more than 100 marked graves, 15 of which are unidentified Confederate dead, and 23 are of those killed in the 1863 Battle of Helena. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.
Forecasting the developing trend of COVID-19 has become a hot topic nowadays. However, two problem exits during training the models on the time series: At the early stage of an outbreak, the limited data are not enough to train a capable model. The outbreak in different regions may have different developing patterns, therefore a single model can’t simulate the pandemic spread in all regions well. Our project aims at providing solution to these problems. Using the time series forecasting models, we propose an approach to predict the trend of an outbreak using data from outbreak in other regions, develop an algorithm for grouping regions sharing similar developing pattern of a pandemic. Our experiments show that our proposed methods can effectively handle those challenges and give decent prediction results. In addition, we build a web application backed by our novel prediction algorithms. The web UI features interactive charts and maps, enabling users to have a clear picture of the ongoing situation of the pandemic.

For the second task, after users input the time period and select region of interest, corresponding data will be fetched and calculated. For instance, if users choose ‘New York’, the geographical position of New York and corresponding data of active cases will be extracted from the csv files. Based on those data, the map will then be programmed to zoom in and focus on the location of New York. On the other hand, under the framework of Tensorflow, our model will load trained weight file. The past 14-day time series of New York will be input into the model to get prediction result. Graphs of predicted time series will then be drawn with plotly, a graphing library.

According to the paper, the SVM model generally outperformed 3 other models due to its ability to handle non-linear relationship and tolerance of complexity. The ARIMA model was able to capture the linear trend of the diseases effectively, however, it could not provide a satisfactory performance on diseases affected by multiple factors, and non-linear relationships existed in some diseases. The regression model and the exponential smoothing model involved less mathematics and statistics thus easier to be understood, and the linear regression model performed better on seasonal epidemics.

48,"Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups indigenous to the Maluku Islands, also called the Moluccas and historically known as the Spice Islands, which as a region has been annexed by Indonesia since the end of 1950. As such, ""Moluccans"" is used as a blanket term for the various ethnic and linguistic groups native to the islands. The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Austronesian and Melanesian in origin. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population in terms of linguistics and other areas, around 2000 BCE due to extensive trade, making Malayo-Polynesian creole languages the lingua franca in most of the region. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences due to colonization, marriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century. Moluccans are predominantly Christian like many other Melanesians, but Muslim villages are also present. Despite religious differences, all groups share strong cultural bonds and a sense of common identity, such as through Adat, Pela and Bongso traditions. Music is also a binding factor, playing an important role in the cultural identity. Moluccans historically tend to be a musically gifted people, excelling in creative areas such as singing and sports. In recognition, the Moluccan capital city of Ambon was awarded the official status of City of Music by UNESCO in 2019.
The Central Connecticut Conference (CCC) is an interscholastic athletic conference in the Greater Hartford region of Connecticut, United States. History In July 1999 founding member Enfield High school would leave the CCC Conference to join the NCCC. E.O. Smith applied to join the CCC Conference in 1999 due to increasing enrollment, E.O. Smith would replace the departing Enfield high school. The Central Connecticut Conference or (CCC) went through major expansion in 2009 with a total of 32 schools participating in the conference. In the 2015–16 school year, Avon High School joined the CCC. This made the conference change back to three divisions of eleven teams, with a blue and a white section in each division, with one having five teams and the other having six. Avon High School moved from the NCCC, where they were the largest school. Some of their competitors were not large enough to have freshman and/or junior varsity teams for Avon to compete against, leading to their move. Avon High school would be replacing Fermi High School which closed its doors at the end of the 2016 academic year, Fermi would merge all of its sports with Enfield High school becoming one school. Also in 2016 Weaver High School a founding member of the CCC Conference in 1984, announced they would be leaving the conference at the end of the 2016-2017 academic year due to low student enrollment. More expansion continued in 2018 when Lewis Mills high school voted to leave the Berkshire league and join the CCC conference beginning conference play in 2019. Lewis Mills would be replacing Rockville high school who left to join the NCCC Conference for the 2017-2018 season.

COVID-19 can cause severe respiratory problems and chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease or diabetes. In addition, COVID-19 can spread rapidly among people and symptoms of infected people have a relatively long incubation period before they are noticeable. Even worse, the virus has recently evolved into several variants recently which are more infectious and may resist the effects of current vaccines. The severe illness caused by COVID-19 and its strong infectiousness make it necessary to contain the spread of the virus as soon as possible.

Israel (Yisrol) Grodner (; ca. 1848 – 1887) was one of the founding performers in Yiddish theater. A Lithuanian Jew who moved at the age of 16 to Berdichev, Ukraine, Russian Empire, the Broder singer and actor was in Iaşi, Romania in 1876 when Abraham Goldfaden recruited him as the first actor for what became the first professional Yiddish theater troupe. Jacob Adler remarks that as the only Lithuanian Jew in the early years of Yiddish theater, he deliberately spoke a different dialect of Yiddish on stage so that it would blend better with the other actors. (The Yiddish of Lithuania differed from that of Ukraine and Romania.) Although his early performances with Goldfaden are usually considered the start of professional Yiddish-language theater, as a Broder singer Grodner was already something of an actor, and he had already participated in an 1873 concert in Odessa, Ukraine in which he and other Broder singers sang songs (including some of Goldfaden's) and improvised comic material between songs that was very similar to Goldfaden's early, highly improvised, comic musical plays. Actor Jacob Adler, already a big fan of the highly regarded Russian language theater in Odessa at that time, and who saw Grodner perform in taverns and restaurants, indicates in his memoir the strong impression Grodner made on him for how well he portrayed his characters. Lulla Rosenfeld writes that Grodner was known in Odessa as ""Srolikl Papirosnik"" (from papiros, cigarette) because he always had a cigarette dangling from his lip.

Xian  refers to a person or thing that is in the middle, in between, or at an intermediate stage. It can also mean a place or state of equilibrium or balance. The name ""Xian"" is composed of the characters ""xian"" meaning ""in the middle"" or ""intermediate"", and ""ren"" meaning ""person or thing"". 

The Xian in Taoism refers to a person who is in the middle of the process of becoming Tao, or the ultimate truth. This person has to go through a lot of trials and tribulations in order to reach their goals. They have to be willing to change and adapt, and they must be willing to let go of things that are no longer necessary.
As mentioned in previous section, we need to divide the states into groups such that states in the same group have similar development patterns for outbreak. Notice that the development pattern here is in fact the feature of time series that will be captured by time series forecasting models during the training process, and the model will be more likely capture the features exists in most samples, which means when we train a model on multiple regions, the model will more likely to learn the developing patterns shared by most regions, and therefore the better developing pattern of a region can be simulated by the model, the more regions does this region share the same pattern. Utilizing this fact, we first train our LSTM model with data from different states, then we evaluate how the model can simulated these states and remove the states that the model can’t simulate well. Assuming the pattern 1 represents the pattern that is shared by some states which we are going to put into a same group, those states that can’t be simulated well definitely contain different patterns other than pattern 1, but among the states that can be simulated well, there might exist states that also sharing some features with both pattern 1 and other patterns, which means these states should not be put into the groups. Therefore, we should train the model on the states left again and remove those states can’t be simulated well, and the process is repeated until all states left can be simulated well by the same LSTM model, which means all these states are sharing some similar developing patterns of outbreak, and then a group can be form using these states. To evaluate how well the model can simulate the developing patterns, we use the Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE) between the prediction result and the ground truth. The formulation of RRSE is shown below.

54,"In Finnish folklore, all places and things, and also human beings, have a haltija (a genius, guardian spirit) of their own. One such haltija is called etiäinen—an image, doppelgänger, or just an impression that goes ahead of a person, doing things the person in question later does. For example, people waiting at home might hear the door close or even see a shadow or a silhouette, only to realize that no one has yet arrived. Etiäinen can also refer to some kind of a feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes it could, for example, warn of a bad year coming. In modern Finnish, the term has detached from its shamanistic origins and refers to premonition. Unlike clairvoyance, divination, and similar practices, etiäiset (plural) are spontaneous and can't be induced. Quite the opposite, they may be unwanted and cause anxiety, like ghosts. Etiäiset need not be too dramatic and may concern everyday events, although ones related to e.g. deaths are common. As these phenomena are still reported today, they can be considered a living tradition, as a way to explain the psychological experience of premonition.
In computer science and mathematics, a full employment theorem is a theorem stating that for any given set of available resources, there exists a unique unemployment equilibrium in which there are no unemployed people.

The full employment theorem is a result of the theory of market equilibrium and was first proposed by Pareto in 1895. The theorem states that if the market has the ability to create full employment, then there will be no unemployment.

There are a few conditions that must be met for the theorem to hold:
1) There must be enough resources available to meet demand.
2) The market must be able to create jobs at the same rate as people enter and leave the workforce.
3) The rate at which jobs are created must be equal to the rate at which people want to work.

The Raven's Claw is an all-male senior honorary society at Dickinson College. It was founded in 1896, making it the first society unique to Dickinson College and one of the oldest in the country. Membership is limited to seven senior men who are selected by the seven previous members. The new members are chosen based on a variety of factors, which are speculated to include: campus leadership, a solid academic record, and athletic participation. While those are often the factors associated with membership in the Raven's Claw Society, no one knows for certain how or why members are selected. Members practice celibacy for the remainder of their time as students after selection. New members are inducted in a ""Tapping Ceremony"" which is held on the ""Old Stone Steps of Old West."" The ceremony is traditionally conducted during commencement weekend. They are called ""claws"" or ""white hats"", denoting the white caps they wear around campus to signify unity and loyalty on certain days throughout the year. History

We also conduct the test of our system and evaluate the performance of our prediction model in Sec. 2.4 and Sec. 2.5 respectively.
In October, 1982, three members of an anarchist urban guerrilla group known as Direct Action acted upon ""their wish to end the arms race"" and filled a stolen pick-up truck with  of dynamite and drove from Vancouver to Toronto, Canada planting the bomb outside Litton Industries, a manufacturer of American cruise missile components many feared would increase the risk of nuclear war. Although the militants had phoned to evacuate the building, the bomb was accidentally detonated several minutes before its announced deadline, injuring several bomb squad police officers and civilians in the vicinity. Litton Industries' role
Litton Industries was conceived as a radio-engineering firm in 1934, but was purchased by Charles Bates Thornton, a Pentagon official with ""all the right connections in the government and military"", in 1956. Litton transformed into a military producer, building entire naval ships in their private shipyards and installing their privately produced equipment including communications and navigation systems.

It connects with the M1 at junction 12 in close proximity to the Toddington services. On its route from Ampthill to Dunstable, the A5120 serves Westoning, Harlington, Toddington and Tebworth. Unusually for an A-road, it does not meet another A-road at any point between its start on the A507 and its end on the A5. This would change if the A505 Dunstable North Bypass were to be built, however. When the A5120 meets the A5 in Dunstable, the latter is multiplexed with the A505 road. The road passes through the Houghton Regis area of Dunstable as it approaches the town from the north. The road actually continues past the A5, without its A5120 number, as an unclassified road, into the Beecroft industrial estate, where it meets the B489 road from Ivinghoe.
Jai Bhim  is a 2021 Indian Tamil-language legal drama film directed by T. J. Gnanavel and produced by Jyothika  and Suriya under 2D Entertainment. The film stars Suriya and Lijomol Jose with Manikandan, Rajisha Vijayan, Prakash Raj, Rao Ramesh and others in supporting roles. The film deals with the subject of police bias and state violence against a marginalised community. Based on a true incident in 1995, which involves a case fought by Justice K. Chandru, it revolves around the lives of Sengeni and Rajakannu, a couple from the Irular tribe. Rajakannu was arrested by the police, and was later missing from the police station. Sengeni seeks the help of an advocate Chandru to seek justice for her husband. Following an official announcement in April 2021, the film began principal photography that month, with many sequences being shot in Chennai and Kodaikanal. Production was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and filming resumed in July 2021. It was completed that September. The film's cinematography and editing were handled by S. R. Kathir and Philomin Raj respectively. The music and film score is composed by Sean Roldan. The film's title is a reference to the slogan used by followers of B. R. Ambedkar.

Norman Lear joined the Q&A session at the end, which was hosted by Patton Oswalt. Cast members promoted the event beforehand using the hashtags ""#PrincessBrideReunion"" and ""#DumpTrumperdinck."" More than 110,000 viewers donated a dollar or more to Wisconsin Democrats to view the livestream, which raised $4.25 million and received widely positive reviews, with special praise for Patinkin's performance. Origin of event The idea to recruit Princess Bride cast members for a fundraiser was inspired by a benefit event organized by Wisconsin Democrats that reunited cast members of The West Wing. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Cary Elwes (Westley in the film) approached a friend who knew Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin to ask if he could help raise money for the battleground state. Wisconsin Democrats and others promoted the virtual script reading with digital ads and social media. Elwes began teasing the event in his Twitter feed in early September 2020, announcing it openly on September 4:#Inconceivable! I’m excited to announce a virtual #PrincessBrideReunion!

In Finnish folklore, all places and things, animate or inanimate, have a spirit or ""etiäinen"" that lives there. Etiäinen can manifest in many forms, but is usually described as a kind, elderly woman with white hair. She is the guardian of natural places and often helps people in need. Etiäinen has been a part of Finnish culture for centuries and is still widely believed in today. Folklorists study etiäinen to understand Finnish traditions and how they have changed over time.

61,"In Finnish folklore, all places and things, and also human beings, have a haltija (a genius, guardian spirit) of their own. One such haltija is called etiäinen—an image, doppelgänger, or just an impression that goes ahead of a person, doing things the person in question later does. For example, people waiting at home might hear the door close or even see a shadow or a silhouette, only to realize that no one has yet arrived. Etiäinen can also refer to some kind of a feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes it could, for example, warn of a bad year coming. In modern Finnish, the term has detached from its shamanistic origins and refers to premonition. Unlike clairvoyance, divination, and similar practices, etiäiset (plural) are spontaneous and can't be induced. Quite the opposite, they may be unwanted and cause anxiety, like ghosts. Etiäiset need not be too dramatic and may concern everyday events, although ones related to e.g. deaths are common. As these phenomena are still reported today, they can be considered a living tradition, as a way to explain the psychological experience of premonition.

Therefore, to fill the gaps, our work thus focuses on the early time series prediction of regional outbreaks. This task can be formulated as zero-shot or few-shot time series prediction (discussed in Sec. 2.1). Zero-shot or few-shot stands for the scarcity of available training data. To mitigate the shortage of data, we employ transfer learning. Transfer learning aims to extract the knowledge from one or more source tasks and applies the knowledge to a target task. In our case, we take the leverage of the relatively sufficient data from regions where the pandemic appears earlier. We also propose a grouping algorithm to assign regions of similar pandemic patterns into groups and train a separate model for each group. Additionally, in order to demonstrate our results, we design and implement a web user interface backed by our prediction models.

62,"Our trained time series forecasting models are the backend for the prediction function, which is taking the user uploaded data from frontend as input and return the required prediction result. We divided the states into five groups, and each group is assigned with one model. In the project, we compare the performance of RNN and LSTM models on each group and select the better one. The RNN model can remember the previous input using its internal memory, which gives it the capability of capturing the pattern of time series. Since our goal is to predict the outbreak’s development at its early stage, the RNN model’s capability draws our attention. However, the RNN model may encounter the vanishing gradient problem which can result in difficulties in updating the parameters of model. Therefore, we also employ LSTM in our experiment, a model commonly used in processing time series that can solve the vanishing gradient problem. The structures of RNN and LSTM models we use are shown in the following figure.
In mathematics, specifically differential calculus, the inverse function theorem gives a sufficient condition for a function to be invertible in a neighborhood of a point in its domain: namely, that its derivative is continuous and non-zero at the point. The theorem also gives a formula for the derivative of the inverse function. In multivariable calculus, this theorem can be generalized to any continuously differentiable, vector-valued function whose Jacobian determinant is nonzero at a point in its domain, giving a formula for the Jacobian matrix of the inverse. There are also versions of the inverse function theorem for complex holomorphic functions, for differentiable maps between manifolds, for differentiable functions between Banach spaces, and so forth. Statement For functions of a single variable, the theorem states that if is a continuously differentiable function with nonzero derivative at the point ; then is invertible in a neighborhood of , the inverse is continuously differentiable, and the derivative of the inverse function at is the reciprocal of the derivative of at :
Hatanpää is a district in Tampere, Finland, located in the southern part of the city center on the shores of Lake Pyhäjärvi. Hatanpää is actually a peninsula that protrudes towards the lake, leaving the waters of Viinikanlahti Bay to the north and Vihilahti Bay to the south. The area is named after Hatanpää Manor, whose land from Härmälä to Sääksjärvi and Nekala was bought for the city in 1913. Administratively, the area has belonged to the city since 1920. In 2014, the population of the area was measured as 2,686 inhabitants. Hatanpää is a well-known district because of its many significant sites, including Hatanpää Manor, Hatanpää Park and Hatanpää Arboretum, primary school and high school, and TAYS' second large hospital area, Hatanpää Hospital, as well as a large number of car dealerships and industry. The busy Hatanpää Highway (Hatanpään valtatie), which branches off from Hämeenkatu, leads directly to the area, sideways to the bus station and Viinikanlahti, and strongly divides it in two. On the east side of the road there are industry and car shops, on the west side and closer to the center there are large office buildings and further south the residential area bordering Hatanpää Park. Several IT companies are located in former houses of Nokia in Hatanpää and in former Sarvis properties. In the vicinity of the office buildings is the Viinikka's wastewater treatment plant, which causes local odor nuisances. However, odor nuisances do not affect residential and park areas.

Death of Cook is the name of several paintings depicting the 1779 death of the first European visitor to the Hawaiian Islands, Captain James Cook at Kealakekua Bay. Most of these paintings seem to go back to an original by John Cleveley the Younger, painted in 1784, although other versions, like that of John Webber, stood model for later copies too. Such artworks were reproduced in paint and engraving over the course of modern world history. The much more famous reproductions, like the one at the Honolulu Museum of Art (allegedly based on the Cleveley version), often depicted Cook as a peacemaker trying to stop the fighting between his sailors and the native Hawaiians that they had challenged in combat. However, in 2004, the original Cleveley painting was discovered in a private collection belonging to a family since 1851. James, Cleveley's brother was a member of Cook's crew, and the painting is said to concur with his drawings and eyewitness accounts. The original depicted Cook involved in hand-to-hand combat with the native Hawaiians. The discovery of the original painting has not changed the way most historians view Cook's relationship with the Hawaiians, as during his last voyage, Cook was reported by his contemporaries to have become irrationally violent. The original watercolour painting, together with three others in a series by Cleveley, was put up for auction by Christie's auction house in London in 2004. The lot of four paintings sold for £318,850 (USD 572,655).

Our work actually develops methods to solve zero-shot and few-shot time series prediction. Zero-shot and few-shot respectively stand for cases where there are no or a few training data of target tasks. There is relatively scarce literature on zero-shot or low-shot time series prediction. Among related works, the existing prevalent method is transfer learning, which is also adopted by us. [18,11] pre-train an RNN-based model on time series from some auxiliary tasks to learn shared features embedding. [18] adopts a Memory-endowed Ordinal Regression Deep Neural Network (MOrdReD) as the backbone model. Its experiments show its proposed framework with transfer learning outperforms the auto regression model. Nevertheless, none of those past works has implemented transfer learning on time series prediction of pandemic transmission. In addition, [15] adapted N-BEATS model [17] to few-shot time series forecasting. The model can achieve satisfying performance on zero-shot and few-shot TS prediction. However, the approach proposed is essentially a variant of N-BEATS rather than a model-agnostic framework. Thus, some mainstream time series prediction models cannot be incorporated into this approach.

Therefore, in terms of sampling, for each state, we start from the first day when the number of cases reported was increasing in its next three days so that all samples contain data of the first outbreak in the state. The first 35 days start from the start of outbreak in each states are used, and they are divided into 8 samples where each sample contains 14 days’ data for input and the next 14 days’ data for output comparison. The dataset we obtained records the cumulative number of cases, however, during the early experiment we noticed that when using daily cumulative number of cases for training, the prediction results for next 14 days may give the decrease of cumulative number of cases during some periods, which is impossible at the early stage of pandemic. Therefore, instead of using the daily cumulative number of cases directly, we use the number of daily reported new cases in our project.

The A5120 is an A-class road in Bedfordshire, linking the conjoined towns of Ampthill and Flitwick to Dunstable and, via the M1 motorway, Luton and London. It connects with the M1 at junction 12 in close proximity to the Toddington services. On its route from Ampthill to Dunstable, the A5120 serves Westoning, Harlington, Toddington and Tebworth. Unusually for an A-road, it does not meet another A-road at any point between its start on the A507 and its end on the A5. This would change if the A505 Dunstable North Bypass were to be built, however. When the A5120 meets the A5 in Dunstable, the latter is multiplexed with the A505 road. The road passes through the Houghton Regis area of Dunstable as it approaches the town from the north. The road actually continues past the A5, without its A5120 number, as an unclassified road, into the Beecroft industrial estate, where it meets the B489 road from Ivinghoe.

The station was on the North Yorkshire and Cleveland's railway line between and , which opened in 1857. The line was extended progressively until it met the Whitby & Pickering Railway at . Sexhow station was closed in 1954 to passengers and four years later to goods. The station was located south of Stockton, and west of Battersby railway station. History The station was opened in April 1857, when the line from Picton was opened up as far as . Mapping shows the station to have had three sidings in the goods yard, coal drops and a crane. The main station buildings were on the westbound (Picton direction) side of the station. The station was south of the village that it served, and was actually in the parish of Carlton in Cleveland, which has led to speculation that it was named Sexhow to avoid confusion with railway station, which was originally named Carlton.

Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups indigenous to the Maluku Islands, also called the Moluccas and historically known as the Spice Islands, which as a region has been annexed by Indonesia since the end of 1950. As such, ""Moluccans"" is used as a blanket term for the various ethnic and linguistic groups native to the islands. The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Austronesian and Melanesian in origin. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population in terms of linguistics and other areas, around 2000 BCE due to extensive trade, making Malayo-Polynesian creole languages the lingua franca in most of the region. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences due to colonization, marriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century. Moluccans are predominantly Christian like many other Melanesians, but Muslim villages are also present. Despite religious differences, all groups share strong cultural bonds and a sense of common identity, such as through Adat, Pela and Bongso traditions. Music is also a binding factor, playing an important role in the cultural identity. Moluccans historically tend to be a musically gifted people, excelling in creative areas such as singing and sports. In recognition, the Moluccan capital city of Ambon was awarded the official status of City of Music by UNESCO in 2019.

72,"Forecasting the developing trend of COVID-19 has become a hot topic nowadays. However, two problem exits during training the models on the time series: At the early stage of an outbreak, the limited data are not enough to train a capable model. The outbreak in different regions may have different developing patterns, therefore a single model can’t simulate the pandemic spread in all regions well. Our project aims at providing solution to these problems. Using the time series forecasting models, we propose an approach to predict the trend of an outbreak using data from outbreak in other regions, develop an algorithm for grouping regions sharing similar developing pattern of a pandemic. Our experiments show that our proposed methods can effectively handle those challenges and give decent prediction results. In addition, we build a web application backed by our novel prediction algorithms. The web UI features interactive charts and maps, enabling users to have a clear picture of the ongoing situation of the pandemic.
The learning process of LSTM was improved by adopting a rolling update mechanism. The rolling update mechanism means the training samples are updated using the current prediction result. In the improved learning process, the collected real-time data was put into model, generating the prediction results of daily confirmed cases of the next day. This prediction result was added into the training data and generated the prediction results of daily confirmed cases of day after the next day. This iterative process generated the long-term prediction curve of the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19. According to their paper, the improved LSTM method provided a forecasting result of daily confirmed cases consistent with the real data and an accurate trend of epidemic.

Death of Cook is the name of a small, unidentified extinct hominin species. It is so far the only known member of its genus and family.

The death of Cook is a remarkable event in the history of human evolution. Cook's remains were discovered in 2003 at the site of a archaeological excavation in Kibish, Ethiopia, and have provided new insights into the human lineage.

Cook was about 1.5 meters tall and had an estimated weight of about fifty kilograms. He had a small skull and robust body proportions typical of early Homo sapiens. His teeth and bones suggest that he ate a diet rich in animal matter, which may have contributed to his robust physique.

Cook's remains provide new clues about our evolutionary history and the origins of early Homo sapiens. His discovery suggests that our ancestors were more physically robust and capable than previously thought, and that they may have been able to survive in colder climates than previously thought.

The Raven's Claw is an all-male senior honorary society at Dickinson College. It was founded in 1896, making it the first society unique to Dickinson College and one of the oldest in the country. Membership is limited to seven senior men who are selected by the seven previous members. The new members are chosen based on a variety of factors, which are speculated to include: campus leadership, a solid academic record, and athletic participation. While those are often the factors associated with membership in the Raven's Claw Society, no one knows for certain how or why members are selected. Members practice celibacy for the remainder of their time as students after selection. New members are inducted in a ""Tapping Ceremony"" which is held on the ""Old Stone Steps of Old West."" The ceremony is traditionally conducted during commencement weekend. They are called ""claws"" or ""white hats"", denoting the white caps they wear around campus to signify unity and loyalty on certain days throughout the year. History

History In July 1999 founding member Enfield High school would leave the CCC Conference to join the NCCC. E.O. Smith applied to join the CCC Conference in 1999 due to increasing enrollment, E.O. Smith would replace the departing Enfield high school. The Central Connecticut Conference or (CCC) went through major expansion in 2009 with a total of 32 schools participating in the conference. In the 2015–16 school year, Avon High School joined the CCC. This made the conference change back to three divisions of eleven teams, with a blue and a white section in each division, with one having five teams and the other having six. Avon High School moved from the NCCC, where they were the largest school. Some of their competitors were not large enough to have freshman and/or junior varsity teams for Avon to compete against, leading to their move. Avon High school would be replacing Fermi High School which closed its doors at the end of the 2016 academic year, Fermi would merge all of its sports with Enfield High school becoming one school. Also in 2016 Weaver High School a founding member of the CCC Conference in 1984, announced they would be leaving the conference at the end of the 2016-2017 academic year due to low student enrollment. More expansion continued in 2018 when Lewis Mills high school voted to leave the Berkshire league and join the CCC conference beginning conference play in 2019. Lewis Mills would be replacing Rockville high school who left to join the NCCC Conference for the 2017-2018 season.
The A5120 is an A-class road in Bedfordshire, linking the conjoined towns of Ampthill and Flitwick to Dunstable and, via the M1 motorway, Luton and London. It connects with the M1 at junction 12 in close proximity to the Toddington services. On its route from Ampthill to Dunstable, the A5120 serves Westoning, Harlington, Toddington and Tebworth. Unusually for an A-road, it does not meet another A-road at any point between its start on the A507 and its end on the A5. This would change if the A505 Dunstable North Bypass were to be built, however. When the A5120 meets the A5 in Dunstable, the latter is multiplexed with the A505 road. The road passes through the Houghton Regis area of Dunstable as it approaches the town from the north. The road actually continues past the A5, without its A5120 number, as an unclassified road, into the Beecroft industrial estate, where it meets the B489 road from Ivinghoe.

The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly by the early isolation of the landmass from the ancient supercontinent containing Africa and India, and by the island's late colonization by human settlers from the Sunda islands (Malay Archipelago) and from East Africa. 
These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of endemic plant and animal species, some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the government not allocating resources to help the growing population, causing many people to resort to harmful environmental practices as a way of survival.
Trade in the Indian Ocean at the time of first colonization of Madagascar was dominated by large ships, called Djong, coming from Java and Sumatra. Over the past two thousand years the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins including Austronesian, Bantu, Arab, South Asian, Chinese and European. The majority of the population of Madagascar today is a mixture of Austronesian and Bantu settlers. Despite popular belief, there has been no genetic input from Arabs or Indians, although one tribe, the Antemoro, claims descent from Somali Arab traders. European and Middle eastern paternal ancestry is also present.
In computer science and mathematics, a full employment theorem is a term used, often humorously, to refer to a theorem which states that no algorithm can optimally perform a particular task done by some class of professionals. The name arises because such a theorem ensures that there is endless scope to keep discovering new techniques to improve the way at least some specific task is done. For example, the full employment theorem for compiler writers states that there is no such thing as a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler, as such a proof for the compiler would have to detect non-terminating computations and reduce them to a one-instruction infinite loop. Thus, the existence of a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler would imply a solution to the halting problem, which cannot exist. This also implies that there may always be a better compiler since the proof that one has the best compiler cannot exist. Therefore, compiler writers will always be able to speculate that they have something to improve. A similar example in practical computer science is the idea of no free lunch in search and optimization, which states that no efficient general-purpose solver can exist, and hence there will always be some particular problem whose best known solution might be improved.

In mathematics, specifically differential calculus, the inverse function theorem gives a sufficient condition for a function to be invertible in a neighborhood of a point in its domain: namely, that its derivative is continuous and non-zero at the point. The theorem also gives a formula for the derivative of the inverse function. In multivariable calculus, this theorem can be generalized to any continuously differentiable, vector-valued function whose Jacobian determinant is nonzero at a point in its domain, giving a formula for the Jacobian matrix of the inverse. There are also versions of the inverse function theorem for complex holomorphic functions, for differentiable maps between manifolds, for differentiable functions between Banach spaces, and so forth. Statement For functions of a single variable, the theorem states that if is a continuously differentiable function with nonzero derivative at the point ; then is invertible in a neighborhood of , the inverse is continuously differentiable, and the derivative of the inverse function at is the reciprocal of the derivative of at :

88,"In computer science and mathematics, a full employment theorem is a theorem stating that for any given set of available resources, there exists a unique unemployment equilibrium in which there are no unemployed people.

The full employment theorem is a result of the theory of market equilibrium and was first proposed by Pareto in 1895. The theorem states that if the market has the ability to create full employment, then there will be no unemployment.

There are a few conditions that must be met for the theorem to hold:
1) There must be enough resources available to meet demand.
2) The market must be able to create jobs at the same rate as people enter and leave the workforce.
3) The rate at which jobs are created must be equal to the rate at which people want to work.
WMML (1230 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a sports format. Licensed to Glens Falls, New York, United States, the station serves the Glens Falls area.  Established in 1959 as WSET, the station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting, through licensee 6 Johnson Road Licenses, Inc., and features programming from Fox Sports Radio. History
What is now WMML began operations in 1959 as WSET, programming a middle of the road format; for a time, the station studios were located in the Queensbury Hotel in Glens Falls. In 1965, WSET changed its call letters to WBZA; the new call letters arose from the station owner's respect for WBZ in Boston. At the time, the station broadcast at 1410 AM with a ""daytime only"" license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  At sunset each day, the station would leave the air until the next day at 6 a.m. In 1971, the format was changed to Top 40. During the later 1970s, WBZA evolved to more of an adult contemporary format, and it eventually changed frequencies to 1230 in late 1982. WBZA flipped formats in 1986 to nostalgia, calling itself ""Real Music"". The WBZA call letters were transferred 1410 AM (which had returned to the air in 1988 under a new license as WSTL) in 1998; at that time, the station changed its call letters to WMML and took on a sports format.
Wang et al. proposed an improved long short-term memory model (LSTM) deep learning method for time series forecasting for the epidemic trends of COVID-19. While the existing LSTM models trained with the total number of reported cases did provide an accurate short-term prediction, these models were not able to provide a long[1]term prediction curve, and they could only predict the rising trend. Therefore, instead of using the total number of cases like the previous research, the number of daily reported cases was used in this project to obtain the long-term prediction curve and predicting the declining trend and the end of epidemic. The data used was the country based daily reported cases between January 22, 2020, and July 7, 2020, collected from John Hopkins university

Those time series forecasting models have been applied during the study of dynamics of epidemic. These researches are based on data of the whole epidemic period or the period long after the outbreak. However, our project aims at forecasting the trend of epidemic at its early stage using the data of this epidemic in other regions, which can greatly contribute to the evaluation of severity and taking countermeasures when epidemics spread to a new region.

90,"Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups inhabiting the Maluku Islands. The term ""Moluccan"" is an umbrella term that covers the various Austronesian and Papuan languages spoken on the islands. The largest group of Moluccans are the Tolo-speaking people. The Maluku Islands are a group of volcanic islands in eastern Indonesia, located about 1,000 kilometres east of Java and 2,000 kilometres south of New Guinea. The islands comprise over 700 islands, with a total land area of approximately 245,000 square kilometres. They have a population of around 1 million people, most of whom are Muslim. The largest island group is the Tolo-speaking region, which comprises over 60% of the population. The Moluccas were first explored by Europeans in 1512. Portuguese explorer João da Nova discovered Ternate and Tidore, while Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen discovered Halmahera and Bougainville. The Moluccas were later visited by Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. British explorer James Cook visited Ternate, Tidore, Halmahera, and Bougainville during his first voyage in 1770–71.

Sexhow station was closed in 1954 to passengers and four years later to goods. The station was located south of Stockton, and west of Battersby railway station. History The station was opened in April 1857, when the line from Picton was opened up as far as . Mapping shows the station to have had three sidings in the goods yard, coal drops and a crane. The main station buildings were on the westbound (Picton direction) side of the station. The station was south of the village that it served, and was actually in the parish of Carlton in Cleveland, which has led to speculation that it was named Sexhow to avoid confusion with railway station, which was originally named Carlton.

91,"Forecasting the developing trend of COVID-19 has become a hot topic nowadays. However, two problem exits during training the models on the time series: At the early stage of an outbreak, the limited data are not enough to train a capable model. The outbreak in different regions may have different developing patterns, therefore a single model can’t simulate the pandemic spread in all regions well. Our project aims at providing solution to these problems. Using the time series forecasting models, we propose an approach to predict the trend of an outbreak using data from outbreak in other regions, develop an algorithm for grouping regions sharing similar developing pattern of a pandemic. Our experiments show that our proposed methods can effectively handle those challenges and give decent prediction results. In addition, we build a web application backed by our novel prediction algorithms. The web UI features interactive charts and maps, enabling users to have a clear picture of the ongoing situation of the pandemic.

Wang et al. proposed an improved long short-term memory model (LSTM) deep learning method for time series forecasting for the epidemic trends of COVID-19. While the existing LSTM models trained with the total number of reported cases did provide an accurate short-term prediction, these models were not able to provide a long[1]term prediction curve, and they could only predict the rising trend. Therefore, instead of using the total number of cases like the previous research, the number of daily reported cases was used in this project to obtain the long-term prediction curve and predicting the declining trend and the end of epidemic. The data used was the country based daily reported cases between January 22, 2020, and July 7, 2020, collected from John Hopkins university

Israel (Yisrol) Grodner (; ca. 1848 – 1887) was one of the founding performers in Yiddish theater. A Lithuanian Jew who moved at the age of 16 to Berdichev, Ukraine, Russian Empire, the Broder singer and actor was in Iaşi, Romania in 1876 when Abraham Goldfaden recruited him as the first actor for what became the first professional Yiddish theater troupe. Jacob Adler remarks that as the only Lithuanian Jew in the early years of Yiddish theater, he deliberately spoke a different dialect of Yiddish on stage so that it would blend better with the other actors. (The Yiddish of Lithuania differed from that of Ukraine and Romania.) Although his early performances with Goldfaden are usually considered the start of professional Yiddish-language theater, as a Broder singer Grodner was already something of an actor, and he had already participated in an 1873 concert in Odessa, Ukraine in which he and other Broder singers sang songs (including some of Goldfaden's) and improvised comic material between songs that was very similar to Goldfaden's early, highly improvised, comic musical plays. Actor Jacob Adler, already a big fan of the highly regarded Russian language theater in Odessa at that time, and who saw Grodner perform in taverns and restaurants, indicates in his memoir the strong impression Grodner made on him for how well he portrayed his characters. Lulla Rosenfeld writes that Grodner was known in Odessa as ""Srolikl Papirosnik"" (from papiros, cigarette) because he always had a cigarette dangling from his lip.

96,"Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups indigenous to the Maluku Islands, also called the Moluccas and historically known as the Spice Islands, which as a region has been annexed by Indonesia since the end of 1950. As such, ""Moluccans"" is used as a blanket term for the various ethnic and linguistic groups native to the islands. The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Austronesian and Melanesian in origin. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population in terms of linguistics and other areas, around 2000 BCE due to extensive trade, making Malayo-Polynesian creole languages the lingua franca in most of the region. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences due to colonization, marriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century. Moluccans are predominantly Christian like many other Melanesians, but Muslim villages are also present. Despite religious differences, all groups share strong cultural bonds and a sense of common identity, such as through Adat, Pela and Bongso traditions. Music is also a binding factor, playing an important role in the cultural identity. Moluccans historically tend to be a musically gifted people, excelling in creative areas such as singing and sports. In recognition, the Moluccan capital city of Ambon was awarded the official status of City of Music by UNESCO in 2019.
In Finnish folklore, all places and things, and also human beings, have a haltija (a genius, guardian spirit) of their own. One such haltija is called etiäinen—an image, doppelgänger, or just an impression that goes ahead of a person, doing things the person in question later does. For example, people waiting at home might hear the door close or even see a shadow or a silhouette, only to realize that no one has yet arrived. Etiäinen can also refer to some kind of a feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes it could, for example, warn of a bad year coming. In modern Finnish, the term has detached from its shamanistic origins and refers to premonition. Unlike clairvoyance, divination, and similar practices, etiäiset (plural) are spontaneous and can't be induced. Quite the opposite, they may be unwanted and cause anxiety, like ghosts. Etiäiset need not be too dramatic and may concern everyday events, although ones related to e.g. deaths are common. As these phenomena are still reported today, they can be considered a living tradition, as a way to explain the psychological experience of premonition.
