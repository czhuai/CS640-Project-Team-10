The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly by the early isolation of the landmass from the ancient supercontinent containing Africa and India, and by the island's late colonization by human settlers from the Sunda islands (Malay Archipelago) and from East Africa. These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of endemic plant and animal species, some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the government not allocating resources to help the growing population, causing many people to resort to harmful environmental practices as a way of survival. It sometimes leaves you in awe as to how long humans have been around for. The mind is a feeble object and is incapable of accurately capturing time. Some of the earliest signs of humans indicate that they had far more advanced technology than we once thought possible. How were the pyramids built? How did we accurately navigate the planet just by looking at the stars? Have we now lost technologies that were once possible before? These are all questions that come to mind once you enter this rabbit hole.
